 Stand in the plague of custom and permit 
The curiosity of nations to deprive me 
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines 
Lag of a brother Why bastard wherefore base 
When my dimensions are as well compact 
My mind as generous and my shape as true 
As honest madams issue Why brand they us 
With base with baseness bastardy base base 
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take 
More composition and fierce quality 
Than doth within a dull stale tired bed 
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops 
Got tween asleep and wake Well then 
Legitimate Edgar I must have your land 
Our fathers love is to the bastard Edmund 
As to the legitimate fine word legitimate 
Well my legitimate if this letter speed 
And my invention thrive Edmund the base 
Shall top the legitimate I grow I prosper 
Now gods stand up for bastards 
Enter GLOUCESTER  
GLOUCESTER  
Kent banishd thus and France in choler parted 
And the king gone tonight subscribed his power 
Confined to exhibition All this done 
Upon the gad Edmund how now what news 
EDMUND  
So please your lordship none 
Putting up the letter  
GLOUCESTER  
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter 
EDMUND  
I know no news my lord

GLOUCESTER
