 Poor Tom that eats the swimming frog the toad 
the tadpole the wallnewt and the water that in 
the fury of his heart when the foul fiend rages 
eats cowdung for sallets swallows the old rat and 
the ditchdog drinks the green mantle of the 
standing pool who is whipped from tithing to 
tithing and stock punished and imprisoned who 
hath had three suits to his back six shirts to his 
body horse to ride and weapon to wear 
But mice and rats and such small deer 
Have been Toms food for seven long year 
Beware my follower Peace Smulkin peace thou fiend 
GLOUCESTER  
What hath your grace no better company

That it doth hate what gets it 
EDGAR  
Poor Toms acold 
GLOUCESTER  
Go in with me my duty cannot suffer 
To obey in all your daughters hard commands 
Though their injunction be to bar my doors 
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you 
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out 
And bring you where both fire and food is ready
