 KING LEAR  
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air 
Hang fated oer mens faults light on thy daughters 
KENT  
He hath no daughters sir 
KING LEAR  
Death traitor nothing could have subdued nature 
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters 
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers 
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh 
Judicious punishment twas this flesh begot 
Those pelican daughters 
EDGAR  
Pillicock sat on Pillicockhill 
Halloo halloo loo loo 
Fool  
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen 
EDGAR  
Take heed o the foul fiend obey thy parents 
keep thy word justly swear not commit not with 
mans sworn spouse set not thy sweet heart on proud 
array Toms acold 
KING LEAR  
What hast thou been 
EDGAR  
A servingman proud in heart and mind that curled 
my hair wore gloves in my cap served the lust of 
my mistress heart and did the act of darkness with 
her swore as many oaths as I spake words and 
broke them in the sweet face of heaven one that 
slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it 
wine loved I deeply dice dearly and in woman 
outparamoured the Turk false of heart light of 
ear bloody of hand hog in sloth fox in stealth 
wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in prey 
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of 
silks betray thy poor heart to woman keep thy foot 
out of brothels thy hand out of plackets thy pen 
from lenders books and defy the foul fiend 
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind 
Says suum mun ha no nonny 
Dolphin my boy my boy sessa let him trot by
