 Exeunt  
SCENE IV A hall in the same 
Enter KENT disguised  
KENT  
If but as well I other accents borrow 
That can my speech defuse my good intent 
May carry through itself to that full issue 
For which I razed my likeness Now banishd Kent 
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemnd 
So may it come thy master whom thou lovest 
Shall find thee full of labours 
Horns within Enter KING LEAR Knights and Attendants  
KING LEAR  
Let me not stay a jot for dinner go get it ready 
Exit an Attendant  
How now what art thou 
KENT  
A man sir 
KING LEAR  
What dost thou profess what wouldst thou with us 
KENT  
I do profess to be no less than I seem to serve 
him truly that will put me in trust to love him 
that is honest to converse with him that is wise 
and says little to fear judgment to fight when I 
cannot choose and to eat no fish 
KING LEAR  
What art thou 
KENT  
A very honesthearted fellow and as poor as the king 
KING LEAR  
If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a 
king thou art poor enough What wouldst thou 
KENT  
Service 
KING LEAR
