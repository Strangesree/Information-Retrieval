 Sister it is not a little I have to say of what 
most nearly appertains to us both I think our 
father will hence tonight 
REGAN  
Thats most certain and with you next month with us 
GONERIL  
You see how full of changes his age is the 
observation we have made of it hath not been 
little he always loved our sister most and 
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off 
appears too grossly 
REGAN  
Tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever 
but slenderly known himself 
GONERIL  
The best and soundest of his time hath been but 
rash then must we look to receive from his age 
not alone the imperfections of longengraffed 
condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness 
that infirm and choleric years bring with them 
REGAN  
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from 
him as this of Kents banishment 
GONERIL  
There is further compliment of leavetaking 
between France and him Pray you lets hit 
together if our father carry authority with 
such dispositions as he bears this last 
surrender of his will but offend us 
REGAN  
We shall further think ont 
GONERIL  
We must do something and i the heat 
Exeunt
