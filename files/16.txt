 EDMUND  
Nor is not sure 
GLOUCESTER  
To his father that so tenderly and entirely 
loves him Heaven and earth Edmund seek him 
out wind me into him I pray you frame the 
business after your own wisdom I would unstate 
myself to be in a due resolution 
EDMUND  
I will seek him sir presently convey the 
business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal 
GLOUCESTER  
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend 
no good to us though the wisdom of nature can 
reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself 
scourged by the sequent effects love cools 
friendship falls off brothers divide in 
cities mutinies in countries discord in 
palaces treason and the bond cracked twixt son 
and father This villain of mine comes under the 
prediction theres son against father the king 
falls from bias of nature theres father against 
child We have seen the best of our time 
machinations hollowness treachery and all 
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our 
graves Find out this villain Edmund it shall 
lose thee nothing do it carefully And the 
noble and truehearted Kent banished his 
offence honesty Tis strange 
Exit

This is the excellent foppery of the world that 
when we are sick in fortune often the surfeit 
of our own behavior we make guilty of our 
disasters the sun the moon and the stars as 
if we were villains by necessity fools by 
heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and 
treachers by spherical predominance drunkards 
liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of 
planetary influence and all that we are evil in 
by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion 
of whoremaster man to lay his goatish
