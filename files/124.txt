 Yet Edmund was beloved 
The one the other poisond for my sake 
And after slew herself 
ALBANY  
Even so Cover their faces 
EDMUND  
I pant for life some good I mean to do 
Despite of mine own nature Quickly send 
Be brief in it to the castle for my writ 
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia 
Nay send in time 
ALBANY  
Run run O run 
EDGAR  
To who my lord Who hath the office send 
Thy token of reprieve 
EDMUND  
Well thought on take my sword 
Give it the captain 
ALBANY  
Haste thee for thy life 
Exit EDGAR  
EDMUND  
He hath commission from thy wife and me 
To hang Cordelia in the prison a nd 
To lay the blame upon her own despair 
That she fordid herself 
ALBANY  
The gods defend her Bear him hence awhile 
EDMUND is borne off  
Reenter KING LEAR with CORDELIA dead in his arms EDGAR Captain and  
others following  
KING LEAR  
Howl howl howl howl O you are men of stones 
Had I your tongues and eyes Ild use them so 
That heavens vault should crack Shes gone for ever 
I know when one is dead and when one lives 
Shes dead as earth Lend me a lookingglass
