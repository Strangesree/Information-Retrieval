 Weapons arms What s the matter here 
CORNWALL  
Keep peace upon your lives 
He dies that strikes again What is the matter 
REGAN  
The messengers from our sister and the king 
CORNWALL  
What is your difference speak 
OSWALD  
I am scarce in breath my lord 
KENT  
No marvel you have so bestirred your valour You 
cowardly rascal nature disclaims in thee a 
tailor made thee 
CORNWALL  
Thou art a strange fellow a tailor make a man 
KENT  
Ay a tailor sir a stonecutter or painter could 
not have made him so ill though he had been but two 
hours at the trade 
CORNWALL  
Speak yet how grew your quarrel 
OSWALD  
This ancient ruffian sir whose life I have spared 
at suit of his gray beard  
KENT  
Thou whoreson zed thou unnecessary letter My 
lord if you will give me leave I will tread this 
unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of 
a jakes with him Spare my gray beard you wagtail 
CORNWALL  
Peace sirrah 
You beastly knave know you no reverence 
KENT  
Yes sir but anger hath a privilege 
CORNWALL  
Why art thou angry 
KENT  
That such a slave as this should wear a sword 
Who wears no honesty Such smiling rogues as these
