 Please you draw near Louder the music there 
CORDELIA  
O my dear father Restoration hang 
Thy medicine on my lips and let this kiss 
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters 
Have in thy reverence made 
KENT  
Kind and dear princess 
CORDELIA  
Had you not been their father these white flakes 
Had challenged pity of them Was this a face 
To be opposed against the warring winds 
To stand against the deep dreadbolted thunder 
In the most terrible and nimble stroke 
Of quick cross lightning to watch poor perdu  
With this thin helm Mine enemys dog 
Though he had bit me should have stood that night 
Against my fire and wast thou fain poor father 
To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn 
In short and musty straw Alack alack 
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once 
Had not concluded all He wakes speak to him 
Doctor  
Madam do you tis fittest 
CORDELIA  
How does my royal lord How fares your majesty 
KING LEAR  
You do me wrong to take me out o the grave 
Thou art a soul in bliss but I am bound 
Upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears 
Do scald like moulten lead 
CORDELIA  
Sir do you know me 
KING LEAR  
You are a spirit I know when did you die 
CORDELIA  
Still still far wide 
Doctor  
Hes scarce awake let him alone awhile 
KING LEAR
