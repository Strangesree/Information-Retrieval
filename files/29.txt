 To understand my purposes aright 
As you are old and reverend you should be wise 
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires 
Men so disorderd so deboshd and bold 
That this our court infected with their manners 
Shows like a riotous inn epicurism and lust 
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel 
Than a graced palace The shame itself doth speak 
For instant remedy be then desired 
By her that else will take the thing she begs 
A little to disquantity your train 
And the remainder that shall still depend 
To be such men as may besort your age 
And know themselves and you 
KING LEAR  
Darkness and devils 
Saddle my horses call my train together 
Degenerate bastard Ill not trouble thee 
Yet have I left a daughter 
GONERIL  
You strike my people and your disorderd rabble 
Make servants of their betters 
Enter ALBANY  
KING LEAR  
Woe that too late repents  
To ALBANY  
O sir are you come 
Is it your will Speak sir Prepare my horses 
Ingratitude thou marblehearted fiend 
More hideous when thou showst thee in a child 
Than the seamonster 
ALBANY  
Pray sir be patient 
KING LEAR  
To GONERIL Detested kite thou liest 
My train are men of choice and rarest parts 
That all particulars of duty know 
And in the most exact regard support 
The worships of their name O most small fault 
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show
