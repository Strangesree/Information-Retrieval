 Fool  
Why to keep ones eyes of either sides nose that 
what a man cannot smell out he may spy into 
KING LEAR  
I did her wrong  
Fool  
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell 
KING LEAR  
No 
Fool  
Nor I neither but I can tell why a snail has a house 
KING LEAR  
Why 
Fool  
Why to put his head in not to give it away to his 
daughters and leave his horns without a case 
KING LEAR  
I will forget my nature So kind a father Be my 
horses ready 
Fool  
Thy asses are gone about em The reason why the 
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason 
KING LEAR  
Because they are not eight 
Fool  
Yes indeed thou wouldst make a good fool 
KING LEAR  
To take t again perforce Monster ingratitude 
Fool  
If thou wert my fool nuncle Ild have thee beaten 
for being old before thy time 
KING LEAR  
Hows that 
Fool  
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst 
been wise 
KING LEAR  
O let me not be mad not mad sweet heaven 
Keep me in temper I would not be mad
