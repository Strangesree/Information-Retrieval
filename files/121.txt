 That hast this fortune on me If thourt noble 
I do forgive thee 
EDGAR  
Lets exchange charity 
I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund 
If more the more thou hast wrongd me 
My name is Edgar and thy fathers son 
The gods are just and of our pleasant vices 
Make instruments to plague us 
The dark and vicious place where thee he got 
Cost him his eyes 
EDMUND  
Thou hast spoken right tis true 
The wheel is come full circle I am here 
ALBANY  
Methought thy very gait did prophesy 
A royal nobleness I must embrace thee 
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I 
Did hate thee or thy father 
EDGAR  
Worthy prince I knowt 
ALBANY  
Where have you hid yourself 
How have you known the miseries of your father 
EDGAR  
By nursing them my lord List a brief tale 
And when tis told O that my heart would burst 
The bloody proclamation to escape 
That followd me so near O our lives sweetness 
That we the pain of death would hourly die 
Rather than die at once taught me to shift 
Into a madmans rags to assume a semblance 
That very dogs disdaind and in this habit 
Met I my father with his bleeding rings 
Their precious stones new lost became his guide 
Led him beggd for him saved him from despair 
Never O fault reveald myself unto him 
Until some halfhour past when I was armd 
Not sure though hoping of this good success 
I askd his blessing and from first to last 
Told him my pilgrimage but his flawd heart 
Alack too weak the conflict to support
