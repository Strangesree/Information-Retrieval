 KING LEAR  
Thou thinkst tis much that this contentious storm 
Invades us to the skin so tis to thee 
But where the greater malady is fixd 
The lesser is scarce felt Thouldst shun a bear 
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea 
Thouldst meet the bear i the mouth When the 
minds free 
The bodys delicate the tempest in my mind 
Doth from my senses take all feeling else 
Save what beats there Filial ingratitude 
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand 
For lifting food tot But I will punish home 
No I will weep no more In such a night 
To shut me out Pour on I will endure 
In such a night as this O Regan Goneril 
Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all  
O that way madness lies let me shun that 
No more of that 
KENT  
Good my lord enter here 
KING LEAR  
Prithee go in thyself seek thine own ease 
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder 
On things would hurt me more But Ill go in 
To the Fool  
In boy go first You houseless poverty  
Nay get thee in Ill pray and then Ill sleep 
Fool goes in  
Poor naked wretches wheresoer you are 
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm 
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides 
Your loopd and windowd raggedness defend you 
From seasons such as these O I have taen 
Too little care of this Take physic pomp 
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel 
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them 
And show the heavens more just
