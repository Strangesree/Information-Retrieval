 EDGAR  
Child Rowland to the dark tower came 
His word was still Fie foh and fum 
I smell the blood of a British man 
Exeunt  
SCENE V Gloucesters castle 
Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND  
CORNWALL  
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house 
EDMUND  
How my lord I may be censured that nature thus 
gives way to loyalty something fears me to think 
of 
CORNWALL  
I now perceive it was not altogether your 
brothers evil disposition made him seek his death 
but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable 
badness in himself 
EDMUND  
How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to 
be just This is the letter he spoke of which 
approves him an intelligent party to the advantages 
of France O heavens that this treason were not 
or not I the detector 
CORNWALL  
o with me to the duchess 
EDMUND  
If the matter of this paper be certain you have 
mighty business in hand 
CORNWALL  
True or false it hath made thee earl of 
Gloucester Seek out where thy father is that he 
may be ready for our apprehension 
EDMUND  
Aside If I find him comforting the king it will 
stuff his suspicion more fully I will persevere in 
my course of loyalty though the conflict be sore 
between that and my blood 
CORNWALL
