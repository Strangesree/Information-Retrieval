 KENT  
Importune him once more to go my lord 
His wits begin to unsettle 
GLOUCESTER  
Canst thou blame him 
Storm still  
His daughters seek his death ah that good Kent 
He said it would be thus poor banishd man 
Thou sayst the king grows mad Ill tell thee friend 
I am almost mad myself I had a son 
Now outlawd from my blood he sought my life 
But lately very late I loved him friend 
No father his son dearer truth to tell thee 
The grief hath crazed my wits What a nights this 
I do beseech your grace  
KING LEAR  
O cry your mercy sir 
Noble philosopher your company 
EDGAR

In fellow there into the hovel keep thee warm 
KING LEAR  
Come lets in all 
KENT  
This way my lord 
KING LEAR

KING LEAR
