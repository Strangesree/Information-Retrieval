 OSWALD  
Would I could meet him madam I should show 
What party I do follow 
REGAN  
Fare thee well 
Exeunt  
SCENE VI Fields near Dover 
Enter GLOUCESTER and EDGAR dressed like a peasant  
GLOUCESTER  
When shall we come to the top of that same hill 
EDGAR  
You do climb up it now look how we labour 
GLOUCESTER  
Methinks the ground is even 
EDGAR  
Horrible steep 
Hark do you hear the sea 
GLOUCESTER  
No truly 
EDGAR  
Why then your other senses grow imperfect 
By your eyes anguish 
GLOUCESTER  
So may it be indeed 
Methinks thy voice is alterd and thou speakst 
In better phrase and matter than thou didst 
EDGAR  
Youre much deceived in nothing am I changed 
But in my garments 
GLOUCESTER  
Methinks youre better spoken 
EDGAR  
Come on sir heres the place stand still How fearful 
And dizzy tis to cast ones eyes so low 
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air 
Show scarce so gross as beetles half way down 
Hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade 
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head
