89 
 O my good lord the Duke of Cornwalls dead 
Slain by his servant going to put out 
The other eye of Gloucester 
ALBANY  
Gloucesters eye 
Messenger  
A servant that he bred thrilld with remorse 
Opposed against the act bending his sword 
To his great master who thereat enraged 
Flew on him and amongst them felld him dead 
But not without that harmful stroke which since 
Hath pluckd him after 
ALBANY  
This shows you are above 
You justicers that these our nether crimes 
So speedily can venge But O poor Gloucester 
Lost he his other eye 
Messenger  
Both both my lord 
This letter madam craves a speedy answer 
Tis from your sister 
GONERIL  
Aside One way I like this well 
But being widow and my Gloucester with her 
May all the building in my fancy pluck 
Upon my hateful life another way 
The news is not so tart Ill read and answer 
Exit 
ALBANY  
Where was his son when they did take his eyes 
Messenger  
Come with my lady hither 
ALBANY  
He is not here 
Messenger  
No my good lord I met him back again 
ALBANY  
Knows he the wickedness 
Messenger
