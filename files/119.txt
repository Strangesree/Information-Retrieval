 Trumpet answers within  
Enter EDGAR at the third sound armed with a trumpet before him  
ALBANY  
Ask him his purposes why he appears 
Upon this call o the trumpet 
Herald  
What are you 
Your name your quality and why you answer 
This present summons 
EDGAR  
Know my name is lost 
By treasons tooth baregnawn and cankerbit 
Yet am I noble as the adversary 
I come to cope 
ALBANY  
Which is that adversary 
EDGAR  
Whats he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester 
EDMUND  
Himself what sayst thou to him 
EDGAR  
Draw thy sword 
That if my speech offend a noble heart 
Thy arm may do thee justice here is mine 
Behold it is the privilege of mine honours 
My oath and my profession I protest 
Maugre thy strength youth place and eminence 
Despite thy victor sword and firenew fortune 
Thy valour and thy heart thou art a traitor 
False to thy gods thy brother and thy father 
Conspirant gainst this highillustrious prince 
And from the extremest upward of thy head 
To the descent and dust below thy foot 
A most toadspotted traitor Say thou No 
This sword this arm and my best spirits are bent 
To prove upon thy heart whereto I speak 
Thou liest 
EDMUND  
In wisdom I should ask thy name 
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike
