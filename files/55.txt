 CORNWALL  
What trumpets that 
REGAN  
I knowt my sisters this approves her letter 
That she would soon be here 
Enter OSWALD  
Is your lady come 
KING LEAR  
This is a slave whose easyborrowd pride 
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows 
Out varlet from my sight 
CORNWALL  
What means your grace 
KING LEAR  
Who stockd my servant Regan I have good hope 
Thou didst not know ont Who comes here O heavens 
Enter GONERIL  
If you do love old men if your sweet sway 
Allow obedience if yourselves are old 
Make it your cause send down and take my part 
To GONERIL  
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard 
O Regan wilt thou take her by the hand 
GONERIL  
Why not by the hand sir How have I offended 
Alls not offence that indiscretion finds 
And dotage terms so 
KING LEAR  
O sides you are too tough 
Will you yet hold How came my man i the stocks 
CORNWALL  
I set him there sir but his own disorders 
Deserved much less advancement 
KING LEAR  
You did you 
REGAN
