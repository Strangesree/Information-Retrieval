 Aside O gods Who ist can say I am at 
the worst 
I am worse than eer I was 
Old Man  
Tis poor mad Tom 
EDGAR  
Aside And worse I may be yet the worst is not 
So long as we can say This is the worst 
Old Man  
Fellow where goest 
GLOUCESTER  
Is it a beggarman 
Old Man  
Madman and beggar too 
GLOUCESTER  
He has some reason else he could not beg 
I the last nights storm I such a fellow saw 
Which made me think a man a worm my son 
Came then into my mind and yet my mind 
Was then scarce friends with him I have heard 
more since 
As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods 
They kill us for their sport 
EDGAR  
Aside How should this be 
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow 
Angering itself and others Bless thee master 
GLOUCESTER  
Is that the naked fellow 
Old Man  
Ay my lord 
GLOUCESTER  
Then prithee get thee gone if for my sake 
Thou wilt oertake us hence a mile or twain 
I the way toward Dover do it for ancient love 
And bring some covering for this naked soul 
Who Ill entreat to lead me 
Old Man  
Alack sir he is mad 
GLOUCESTER
