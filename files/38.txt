38 
 Exeunt some Servants  
By no means what 
EDMUND  
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship 
But that I told him the revenging gods 
Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend 
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond 
The child was bound to the father sir in fine 
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood 
To his unnatural purpose in fell motion 
With his prepared sword he charges home 
My unprovided body lanced mine arm 
But when he saw my best alarumd spirits 
Bold in the quarrels right roused to the encounter 
Or whether gasted by the noise I made 
Full suddenly he fled 
GLOUCESTER  
Let him fly far 
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught 
And found dispatch The noble duke my master 
My worthy arch and patron comes tonight 
By his authority I will proclaim it 
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks 
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake 
He that conceals him death 
EDMUND  
When I dissuaded him from his intent 
And found him pight to do it with curst speech 
I threatend to discover him he replied 
Thou unpossessing bastard dost thou think 
If I would stand against thee would the reposal 
Of any trust virtue or worth in thee 
Make thy words faithd No what I should deny  
As this I would ay though thou didst produce 
My very character Ild turn it all 
To thy suggestion plot and damned practise 
And thou must make a dullard of the world 
If they not thought the profits of my death 
Were very pregnant and potential spurs 
To make thee seek it 
GLOUCESTER
