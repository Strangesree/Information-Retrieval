 ACT IV 
SCENE I The heath 
Enter EDGAR  
EDGAR  
Yet better thus and known to be contemnd 
Than still contemnd and flatterd To be worst 
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune 
Stands still in esperance lives not in fear 
The lamentable change is from the best 
The worst returns to laughter Welcome then 
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace 
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst 
Owes nothing to thy blasts But who comes here 
Enter GLOUCESTER led by an Old Man  
My father poorly led World world O world 
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee 
Lie would not yield to age 
Old Man  
O my good lord I have been your tenant and 
your fathers tenant these fourscore years 
GLOUCESTER  
Away get thee away good friend be gone 
Thy comforts can do me no good at all 
Thee they may hurt 
Old Man  
Alack sir you cannot see your way 
GLOUCESTER  
I have no way and therefore want no eyes 
I stumbled when I saw full oft tis seen 
Our means secure us and our mere defects 
Prove our commodities O dear son Edgar 
The food of thy abused fathers wrath 
Might I but live to see thee in my touch 
Ild say I had eyes again 
Old Man  
How now Whos there 
EDGAR
