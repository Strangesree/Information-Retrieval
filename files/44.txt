 Like rats oft bite the holy cords atwain 
Which are too intrinse t unloose smooth every passion 
That in the natures of their lords rebel 
Bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods 
Renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks 
With every gale and vary of their masters 
Knowing nought like dogs but following 
A plague upon your epileptic visage 
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool 
Goose if I had you upon Sarum plain 
Ild drive ye cackling home to Camelot 
CORNWALL  
Why art thou mad old fellow 
GLOUCESTER  
How fell you out say that 
KENT  
No contraries hold more antipathy 
Than I and such a knave 
CORNWALL  
Why dost thou call him a knave Whats his offence 
KENT  
His countenance likes me not 
CORNWALL  
No more perchance does mine nor his nor hers 
KENT  
Sir tis my occupation to be plain 
I have seen better faces in my time 
Than stands on any shoulder that I see 
Before me at this instant 
CORNWALL  
This is some fellow 
Who having been praised for bluntness doth affect 
A saucy roughness and constrains the garb 
Quite from his nature he cannot flatter he 
An honest mind and plain he must speak truth 
An they will take it so if not hes plain 
These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness 
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends 
Than twenty silly ducking observants 
That stretch their duties nicely 
KENT
