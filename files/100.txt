 O ruind piece of nature This great world 
Shall so wear out to nought Dost thou know me 
KING LEAR  
I remember thine eyes well enough Dost thou squiny 
at me No do thy worst blind Cupid Ill not 
love Read thou this challenge mark but the 
penning of it 
GLOUCESTER  
Were all the letters suns I could not see one 
EDGAR  
I would not take this from report it is 
And my heart breaks at it 
KING LEAR  
Read 
GLOUCESTER  
What with the case of eyes 
KING LEAR  
O ho are you there with me No eyes in your 
head nor no money in your purse Your eyes are in 
a heavy case your purse in a light yet you see how 
this world goes 
GLOUCESTER  
I see it feelingly 
KING LEAR  
What art mad A man may see how this world goes 
with no eyes Look with thine ears see how yond 
justice rails upon yond simple thief Hark in 
thine ear change places and handydandy which 
is the justice which is the thief Thou hast seen 
a farmers dog bark at a beggar 
GLOUCESTER  
Ay sir 
KING LEAR  
And the creature run from the cur There thou 
mightst behold the great image of authority a 
dogs obeyed in office 
Thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand 
Why dost thou lash that whore Strip thine own back 
Thou hotly lustst to use her in that kind 
For which thou whippst her The usurer hangs the cozener 
Through tatterd clothes small vices do appear
