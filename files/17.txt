 disposition to the charge of a star My 
father compounded with my mother under the 
dragons tail and my nativity was under Ursa 
major so that it follows I am rough and 
lecherous Tut I should have been that I am 
had the maidenliest star in the firmament 
twinkled on my bastardizing Edgar  
Enter EDGAR  
And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old 
comedy my cue is villanous melancholy with a 
sigh like Tom o Bedlam O these eclipses do 
portend these divisions fa sol la mi 
EDGAR  
How now brother Edmund what serious 
contemplation are you in 
EDMUND  
I am thinking brother of a prediction I read 
this other day what should follow these eclipses 
EDGAR  
Do you busy yourself about that 
EDMUND  
I promise you the effects he writes of succeed 
unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child 
and the parent death dearth dissolutions of 
ancient amities divisions in state menaces and 
maledictions against king and nobles needless 
diffidences banishment of friends dissipation 
of cohorts nuptial breaches and I know not what 
EDGAR  
How long have you been a sectary astronomical 
EDMUND  
Come come when saw you my father last 
EDGAR  
Why the night gone by 
EDMUND  
Spake you with him 
EDGAR  
Ay two hours together 
EDMUND
