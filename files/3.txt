Meantime we shall express our darker purpose 
Give me the map there Know that we have divided 
In three our kingdom and tis our fast intent 
To shake all cares and business from our age 
Conferring them on younger strengths while we 
Unburthend crawl toward death Our son of Cornwall 
And you our no less loving son of Albany 
We have this hour a constant will to publish 
Our daughters several dowers that future strife 
May be prevented now The princes France and Burgundy 
Great rivals in our youngest daughters love 
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn 
And here are to be answerd Tell me my daughters  
Since now we will divest us both of rule 
Interest of territory cares of state  
Which of you shall we say doth love us most 
That we our largest bounty may extend 
Where nature doth with merit challenge Goneril 
Our eldestborn speak first
