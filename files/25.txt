 Do 
Fool  
Mark it nuncle 
Have more than thou showest 
Speak less than thou knowest 
Lend less than thou owest 
Ride more than thou goest 
Learn more than thou trowest 
Set less than thou throwest 
Leave thy drink and thy whore 
And keep inadoor 
And thou shalt have more 
Than two tens to a score 
KENT  
This is nothing fool 
Fool  
Then tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer you 
gave me nothing fort Can you make no use of 
nothing nuncle 
KING LEAR  
Why no boy nothing can be made out of nothing 
Fool  
To KENT Prithee tell him so much the rent of 
his land comes to he will not believe a fool 
KING LEAR  
A bitter fool 
Fool  
Dost thou know the difference my boy between a 
bitter fool and a sweet fool 
KING LEAR  
No lad teach me 
Fool  
That lord that counselld thee 
To give away thy land 
Come place him here by me 
Do thou for him stand 
The sweet and bitter fool 
Will presently appear 
The one in motley here 
The other found out there 
KING LEAR
