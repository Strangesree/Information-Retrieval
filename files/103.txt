 EDGAR  
I thank you sir 
Exit Gentleman  
GLOUCESTER  
You evergentle gods take my breath from me 
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again 
To die before you please 
EDGAR  
Well pray you father 
GLOUCESTER  
Now good sir what are you 
EDGAR  
A most poor man made tame to fortunes blows 
Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows 
Am pregnant to good pity Give me your hand 
Ill lead you to some biding 
GLOUCESTER  
Hearty thanks 
The bounty and the benison of heaven 
To boot and boot 
Enter OSWALD  
OSWALD  
A proclaimd prize Most happy 
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh 
To raise my fortunes Thou old unhappy traitor 
Briefly thyself remember the sword is out 
That must destroy thee 
GLOUCESTER  
Now let thy friendly hand 
Put strength enough tot 
EDGAR interposes  
OSWALD  
Wherefore bold peasant 
Darest thou support a publishd traitor Hence 
Lest that the infection of his fortune take 
Like hold on thee Let go his arm 
EDGAR
