 Whats the matter sir 
KING LEAR  
Ill tell thee 
To GONERIL  
Life and death I am ashamed 
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus 
That these hot tears which break from me perforce 
Should make thee worth them Blasts and fogs upon thee 
The untented woundings of a fathers curse 
Pierce every sense about thee Old fond eyes 
Beweep this cause again Ill pluck ye out 
And cast you with the waters that you lose 
To temper clay Yea it is come to this 
Let is be so yet have I left a daughter 
Who I am sure is kind and comfortable 
When she shall hear this of thee with her nails 
Shell flay thy wolvish visage Thou shalt find 
That Ill resume the shape which thou dost think 
I have cast off for ever thou shalt 
I warrant thee 
Exeunt KING LEAR KENT and Attendants  
GONERIL  
Do you mark that my lord 
ALBANY  
I cannot be so partial Goneril 
To the great love I bear you  
GONERIL  
Pray you content What Oswald ho 
To the Fool  
You sir more knave than fool after your master 
Fool  
Nuncle Lear nuncle Lear tarry and take the fool 
with thee 
A fox when one has caught her 
And such a daughter 
Should sure to the slaughter 
If my cap would buy a halter 
So the fool follows after
