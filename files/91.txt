 Were like a better way those happy smilets 
That playd on her ripe lip seemd not to know 
What guests were in her eyes which parted thence 
As pearls from diamonds droppd In brief 
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved 
If all could so become it 
KENT  
Made she no verbal question 
Gentleman  
Faith once or twice she heaved the name of father 
Pantingly forth as if it pressd her heart 
Cried Sisters sisters Shame of ladies sisters 
Kent father sisters What i the storm i the night 
Let pity not be believed There she shook 
The holy water from her heavenly eyes 
And clamour moistend then away she started 
To deal with grief alone 
KENT  
It is the stars 
The stars above us govern our conditions 
Else one self mate and mate could not beget 
Such different issues You spoke not with her since 
Gentleman  
No 
KENT  
Was this before the king returnd 
Gentleman  
No since 
KENT  
Well sir the poor distressed Lears i the town 
Who sometime in his better tune remembers 
What we are come about and by no means 
Will yield to see his daughter 
Gentleman  
Why good sir 
KENT  
A sovereign shame so elbows him his own unkindness 
That strippd her from his benediction turnd her 
To foreign casualties gave her dear rights 
To his doghearted daughters these things sting 
His mind so venomously that burning shame 
Detains him from Cordelia
