 REGAN  
How now you dog 
First Servant  
If you did wear a beard upon your chin 
Id shake it on this quarrel What do you mean 
CORNWALL  
My villain 
They draw and fight  
First Servant  
Nay then come on and take the chance of anger 
REGAN  
Give me thy sword A peasant stand up thus 
Takes a sword and runs at him behind  
First Servant  
O I am slain My lord you have one eye left 
To see some mischief on him O 
Dies 
CORNWALL  
Lest it see more prevent it Out vile jelly 
Where is thy lustre now 
GLOUCESTER  
All dark and comfortless Wheres my son Edmund 
Edmund enkindle all the sparks of nature 
To quit this horrid act 
REGAN  
Out treacherous villain 
Thou callst on him that hates thee it was he 
That made the overture of thy treasons to us 
Who is too good to pity thee 
GLOUCESTER  
O my follies then Edgar was abused 
Kind gods forgive me that and prosper him 
REGAN  
Go thrust him out at gates and let him smell 
His way to Dover 
Exit one with GLOUCESTER
