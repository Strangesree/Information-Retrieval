 Gentleman  
Alack poor gentleman 
KENT  
Of Albanys and Cornwalls powers you heard not 
Gentleman  
Tis so they are afoot 
KENT  
Well sir Ill bring you to our master Lear 
And leave you to attend him some dear cause 
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile 
When I am known aright you shall not grieve 
Lending me this acquaintance I pray you go 
Along with me 
Exeunt  
SCENE IV The same A tent 
Enter with drum and colours CORDELIA Doctor and Soldiers  
CORDELIA  
Alack tis he why he was met even now 
As mad as the vexd sea singing aloud 
Crownd with rank fumiter and furrowweeds 
With burdocks hemlock nettles cuckooflowers 
Darnel and all the idle weeds that grow 
In our sustaining corn A century send forth 
Search every acre in the highgrown field 
And bring him to our eye 
Exit an Officer  
What can mans wisdom 
In the restoring his bereaved sense 
He that helps him take all my outward worth 
Doctor  
There is means madam 
Our fosternurse of nature is repose 
The which he lacks that to provoke in him 
Are many simples operative whose power 
Will close the eye of anguish 
CORDELIA  
All blest secrets 
All you unpublishd virtues of the earth
