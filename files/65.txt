 GLOUCESTER  
Go to say you nothing Theres a division betwixt 
the dukes and a worse matter than that I have 
received a letter this night tis dangerous to be 
spoken I have locked the letter in my closet 
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged 
home theres part of a power already footed we 
must incline to the king I will seek him and 
privily relieve him go you and maintain talk with 
the duke that my charity be not of him perceived 
if he ask for me I am ill and gone to bed 
Though I die for it as no less is threatened me 
the king my old master must be relieved There is 
some strange thing toward Edmund pray you be careful 
Exit 
EDMUND  
This courtesy forbid thee shall the duke 
Instantly know and of that letter too 
This seems a fair deserving and must draw me 
That which my father loses no less than all 
The younger rises when the old doth fall 
Exit 
SCENE IV The heath Before a hovel 
Enter KING LEAR KENT and Fool

The tyranny of the open nights too rough 
For nature to endure 
Storm still

KING LEAR  
Wilt break my heart 
KENT
