 Tis the times plague when madmen lead the blind 
Do as I bid thee or rather do thy pleasure 
Above the rest be gone

mopping and mowing who since possesses chambermaids 
and waitingwomen So bless thee master

Have humbled to all strokes that I am wretched 
Makes thee the happier heavens deal so still

Because he doth not feel feel your power quickly 
So distribution should undo excess 
And each man have enough Dost thou know Dover
