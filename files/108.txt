 Where have I been Where am I Fair daylight 
I am mightily abused I should een die with pity 
To see another thus I know not what to say 
I will not swear these are my hands lets see 
I feel this pin prick Would I were assured 
Of my condition 
CORDELIA  
O look upon me sir 
And hold your hands in benediction oer me 
No sir you must not kneel 
KING LEAR  
Pray do not mock me 
I am a very foolish fond old man 
Fourscore and upward not an hour more nor less 
And to deal plainly 
I fear I am not in my perfect mind 
Methinks I should know you and know this man 
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant 
What place this is and all the skill I have 
Remembers not these garments nor I know not 
Where I did lodge last night Do not laugh at me 
For as I am a man I think this lady 
To be my child Cordelia 
CORDELIA  
And so I am I am 
KING LEAR  
Be your tears wet yes faith I pray weep not 
If you have poison for me I will drink it 
I know you do not love me for your sisters 
Have as I do remember done me wrong 
You have some cause they have not 
CORDELIA  
No cause no cause 
KING LEAR  
Am I in France 
KENT  
In your own kingdom sir 
KING LEAR  
Do not abuse me 
Doctor  
Be comforted good madam the great rage 
You see is killd in him and yet it is danger
