 No What needed then that terrible dispatch of 
it into your pocket the quality of nothing hath 
not such need to hide itself Lets see come 
if it be nothing I shall not need spectacles 
EDMUND  
I beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter 
from my brother that I have not all oerread 
and for so much as I have perused I find it not 
fit for your oerlooking 
GLOUCESTER  
Give me the letter sir 
EDMUND  
I shall offend either to detain or give it The 
contents as in part I understand them are to blame 
GLOUCESTER  
Lets see lets see 
EDMUND  
I hope for my brothers justification he wrote 
this but as an essay or taste of my virtue 
GLOUCESTER  
Reads This policy and reverence of age makes 
the world bitter to the best of our times keeps 
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish 
them I begin to find an idle and fond bondage 
in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not 
as it hath power but as it is suffered Come to 
me that of this I may speak more If our father 
would sleep till I waked him you should half his 
revenue for ever and live the beloved of your 
brother EDGAR 
Hum conspiracy Sleep till I waked him you 
should enjoy half his revenue My son Edgar 
Had he a hand to write this a heart and brain 
to breed it in When came this to you who 
brought it 
EDMUND  
It was not brought me my lord theres the 
cunning of it I found it thrown in at the 
casement of my closet 
GLOUCESTER  
You know the character to be your brother s
