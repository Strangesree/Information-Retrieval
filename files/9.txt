 But now her price is falln Sir there she stands 
If aught within that little seeming substance 
Or all of it with our displeasure pieced 
And nothing more may fitly like your grace 
Shes there and she is yours 
BURGUNDY  
I know no answer 
KING LEAR  
Will you with those infirmities she owes 
Unfriended newadopted to our hate 
Dowerd with our curse and strangerd with our oath 
Take her or leave her 
BURGUNDY  
Pardon me royal sir 
Election makes not up on such conditions 
KING LEAR  
Then leave her sir for by the power that made me 
I tell you all her wealth 
To KING OF FRANCE  
For you great king 
I would not from your love make such a stray 
To match you where I hate therefore beseech you 
To avert your liking a more worthier way 
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed 
Almost to acknowledge hers 
KING OF FRANCE  
This is most strange 
That she that even but now was your best object 
The argument of your praise balm of your age 
Most best most dearest should in this trice of time 
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle 
So many folds of favour Sure her offence 
Must be of such unnatural degree 
That monsters it or your forevouchd affection 
Falln into taint which to believe of her 
Must be a faith that reason without miracle 
Could never plant in me 
CORDELIA  
I yet beseech your majesty  
If for I want that glib and oily art 
To speak and purpose not since what I well intend
