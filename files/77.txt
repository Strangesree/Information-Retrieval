 Come help to bear thy master 
Thou must not stay behind 
GLOUCESTER  
Come come away 
Exeunt all but EDGAR  
EDGAR  
When we our betters see bearing our woes 
We scarcely think our miseries our foes 
Who alone suffers suffers most i the mind 
Leaving free things and happy shows behind 
But then the mind much sufferance doth oer skip 
When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship 
How light and portable my pain seems now 
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow 
He childed as I fatherd Tom away 
Mark the high noises and thyself bewray 
When false opinion whose wrong thought defiles thee 
In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee 
What will hap more tonight safe scape the king
