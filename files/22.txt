 KING LEAR  
What says the fellow there Call the clotpoll back 
Exit a Knight  
Wheres my fool ho I think the worlds asleep 
Reenter Knight  
How now wheres that mongrel 
Knight  
He says my lord your daughter is not well 
KING LEAR  
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him 
Knight  
Sir he answered me in the roundest manner he would 
not 
KING LEAR  
He would not 
Knight  
My lord I know not what the matter is but to my 
judgment your highness is not entertained with that 
ceremonious affection as you were wont theres a 
great abatement of kindness appears as well in the 
general dependants as in the duke himself also and 
your daughter 
KING LEAR  
Ha sayest thou so 
Knight  
I beseech you pardon me my lord if I be mistaken 
for my duty cannot be silent when I think your 
highness wronged 
KING LEAR  
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception I 
have perceived a most faint neglect of late which I 
have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity 
than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness 
I will look further intot But wheres my fool I 
have not seen him this two days 
Knight  
Since my young ladys going into France sir the 
fool hath much pined away
