 Sir in good sooth in sincere verity 
Under the allowance of your great aspect 
Whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire 
On flickering Phoebus front  
CORNWALL  
What meanst by this 
KENT  
To go out of my dialect which you 
discommend so much I know sir I am no 
flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain 
accent was a plain knave which for my part 
I will not be though I should win your displeasure 
to entreat me to t 
CORNWALL  
What was the offence you gave him 
OSWALD  
I never gave him any 
It pleased the king his master very late 
To strike at me upon his misconstruction 
When he conjunct and flattering his displeasure 
Trippd me behind being down insulted raild 
And put upon him such a deal of man 
That worthied him got praises of the king 
For him attempting who was selfsubdued 
And in the fleshment of this dread exploit 
Drew on me here again 
KENT  
None of these rogues and cowards 
But Ajax is their fool 
CORNWALL  
Fetch forth the stocks 
You stubborn ancient knave you reverend braggart 
Well teach you  
KENT  
Sir I am too old to learn 
Call not your stocks for me I serve the king 
On whose employment I was sent to you 
You shall do small respect show too bold malice 
Against the grace and person of my master 
Stocking his messenger 
CORNWALL
