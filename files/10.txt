10 
 Ill dot before I speak that you make known 
It is no vicious blot murder or foulness 
No unchaste action or dishonourd step 
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour 
But even for want of that for which I am richer 
A stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue 
As I am glad I have not though not to have it 
Hath lost me in your liking 
KING LEAR  
Better thou 
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better 
KING OF FRANCE  
Is it but this a tardiness in nature 
Which often leaves the history unspoke 
That it intends to do My lord of Burgundy 
What say you to the lady Loves not love 
When it is mingled with regards that stand 
Aloof from the entire point Will you have her 
She is herself a dowry 
BURGUNDY  
Royal Lear 
Give but that portion which yourself proposed 
And here I take Cordelia by the hand 
Duchess of Burgundy 
KING LEAR  
Nothing I have sworn I am firm 
BURGUNDY  
I am sorry then you have so lost a father 
That you must lose a husband 
CORDELIA  
Peace be with Burgundy 
Since that respects of fortune are his love 
I shall not be his wife 
KING OF FRANCE  
Fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor 
Most choice forsaken and most loved despised 
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon 
Be it lawful I take up whats cast away 
Gods gods tis strange that from their coldst neglect 
My love should kindle to inflamed respect 
Thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance 
Is queen of us of ours and our fair France
