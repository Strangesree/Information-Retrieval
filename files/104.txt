Good gentleman go your gait and let poor volk

Chill pick your teeth zir come no matter vor

They fight and EDGAR knocks him down  
OSWALD  
Slave thou hast slain me villain take my purse 
If ever thou wilt thrive bury my body 
And give the letters which thou findst about me 
To Edmund earl of Gloucester seek him out 
Upon the British party O untimely death 
Dies 
EDGAR  
I know thee well a serviceable villain 
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress 
As badness would desire 
GLOUCESTER  
What is he dead 
EDGAR  
Sit you down father rest you 
Lets see these pockets the letters that he speaks of 
May be my friends Hes dead I am only sorry 
He had no other deathsman Let us see 
Leave gentle wax and manners blame us not 
To know our enemies minds weld rip their hearts 
Their papers is more lawful
