 Storm still  
KING LEAR  
Why thou wert better in thy grave than to answer 
with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies 
Is man no more than this Consider him well Thou 
owest the worm no silk the beast no hide the sheep 
no wool the cat no perfume Ha heres three on 
s are sophisticated Thou art the thing itself 
unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare 
forked animal as thou art Off off you lendings 
come unbutton here 
Tearing off his clothes  
Fool  
Prithee nuncle be contented tis a naughty night 
to swim in Now a little fire in a wild field were 
like an old lechers heart a small spark all the 
rest ons body cold Look here comes a walking fire 
Enter GLOUCESTER with a torch  
EDGAR  
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet he begins 
at curfew and walks till the first cock he gives 
the web and the pin squints the eye and makes the 
harelip mildews the white wheat and hurts the 
poor creature of earth 
S Withold footed thrice the old 
He met the nightmare and her ninefold 
Bid her alight 
And her troth plight 
And aroint thee witch aroint thee 
KENT  
How fares your grace 
KING LEAR  
Whats he 
KENT  
Whos there What ist you seek 
GLOUCESTER  
What are you there Your names 
EDGAR
