Your servant Kent Where is your servant Caius 
KING LEAR  
Hes a good fellow I can tell you that 
Hell strike and quickly too hes dead and rotten 
KENT  
No my good lord I am the very man  
KING LEAR  
Ill see that straight 
KENT  
That from your first of difference and decay 
Have followd your sad steps 
KING LEAR  
You are welcome hither 
KENT  
Nor no man else alls cheerless dark and deadly 
Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves 
And desperately are dead 
KING LEAR  
Ay so I think 
ALBANY  
He knows not what he says and vain it is 
That we present us to him 
EDGAR  
Very bootless 
Enter a Captain  
Captain  
Edmund is dead my lord 
ALBANY  
Thats but a trifle here 
You lords and noble friends know our intent 
What comfort to this great decay may come 
Shall be applied for us we will resign 
During the life of this old majesty 
To him our absolute power 
To EDGAR and KENT  
you to your rights 
With boot and such addition as your honours
