 Pray do not sir I have watched and travelld hard 
Some time I shall sleep out the rest Ill whistle 
A good mans fortune may grow out at heels 
Give you good morrow 
GLOUCESTER  
The dukes to blame in this twill be ill taken 
Exit 
KENT  
Good king that must approve the common saw 
Thou out of heavens benediction comest 
To the warm sun 
Approach thou beacon to this under globe 
That by thy comfortable beams I may 
Peruse this letter Nothing almost sees miracles 
But misery I know tis from Cordelia 
Who hath most fortunately been informd 
Of my obscured course and shall find time 
From this enormous state seeking to give 
Losses their remedies All weary and oerwatchd 
Take vantage heavy eyes not to behold 
This shameful lodging 
Fortune good night smile once more turn thy wheel 
Sleeps  
SCENE III A wood 
Enter EDGAR  
EDGAR  
I heard myself proclaimd 
And by the happy hollow of a tree 
Escaped the hunt No port is free no place 
That guard and most unusual vigilance 
Does not attend my taking Whiles I may scape 
I will preserve myself and am bethought 
To take the basest and most poorest shape 
That ever penury in contempt of man 
Brought near to beast my face Ill grime with filth 
Blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots 
And with presented nakedness outface 
The winds and persecutions of the sky 
The country gives me proof and precedent
