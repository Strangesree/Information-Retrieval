88 
 A father and a gracious aged man 
Whose reverence even the headluggd bear would lick 
Most barbarous most degenerate have you madded 
Could my good brother suffer you to do it 
A man a prince by him so benefited 
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits 
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences 
It will come 
Humanity must perforce prey on itself 
Like monsters of the deep 
GONERIL  
Milkliverd man 
That bearst a cheek for blows a head for wrongs 
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning 
Thine honour from thy suffering that not knowst 
Fools do those villains pity who are punishd 
Ere they have done their mischief Wheres thy drum 
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land 
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats 
Whiles thou a moral fool sitst still and criest 
Alack why does he so 
ALBANY  
See thyself devil 
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend 
So horrid as in woman 
GONERIL  
O vain fool 
ALBANY  
Thou changed and selfcoverd thing for shame 
Bemonster not thy feature Weret my fitness 
To let these hands obey my blood 
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear 
Thy flesh and bones howeer thou art a fiend 
A womans shape doth shield thee 
GONERIL  
Marry your manhood now  
Enter a Messenger  
ALBANY  
What news
