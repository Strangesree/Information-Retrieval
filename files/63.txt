 Fool  
Marry heres grace and a codpiece thats a wise 
man and a fool 
KENT  
Alas sir are you here things that love night 
Love not such nights as these the wrathful skies 
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark 
And make them keep their caves since I was man 
Such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder 
Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never 
Remember to have heard mans nature cannot carry 
The affliction nor the fear 
KING LEAR  
Let the great gods 
That keep this dreadful pother oer our heads 
Find out their enemies now Tremble thou wretch 
That hast within thee undivulged crimes 
Unwhippd of justice hide thee thou bloody hand 
Thou perjured and thou simular man of virtue 
That art incestuous caitiff to pieces shake 
That under covert and convenient seeming 
Hast practised on mans life close pentup guilts 
Rive your concealing continents and cry 
These dreadful summoners grace I am a man 
More sinnd against than sinning 
KENT  
Alack bareheaded 
Gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel 
Some friendship will it lend you gainst the tempest 
Repose you there while I to this hard house  
More harder than the stones whereof tis raised 
Which even but now demanding after you 
Denied me to come in return and force 
Their scanted courtesy 
KING LEAR  
My wits begin to turn 
Come on my boy how dost my boy art cold 
I am cold myself Where is this straw my fellow 
The art of our necessities is strange 
That can make vile things precious Come 
your hovel 
Poor fool and knave I have one part in my heart 
Thats sorry yet for thee
