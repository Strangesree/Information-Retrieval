 Have you not spoken gainst the Duke of Cornwall 
Hes coming hither now i the night i the haste 
And Regan with him have you nothing said 
Upon his party gainst the Duke of Albany 
Advise yourself 
EDGAR  
I am sure ont not a word 
EDMUND  
I hear my father coming pardon me 
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you 
Draw seem to defend yourself now quit you well 
Yield come before my father Light ho here 
Fly brother Torches torches So farewell 
Exit EDGAR  
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion 
Wounds his arm  
Of my more fierce endeavour I have seen drunkards 
Do more than this in sport Father father 
Stop stop No help 
Enter GLOUCESTER and Servants with torches  
GLOUCESTER  
Now Edmund wheres the villain 
EDMUND  
Here stood he in the dark his sharp sword out 
Mumbling of wicked charms conjuring the moon 
To stand auspicious mistress  
GLOUCESTER  
But where is he 
EDMUND  
Look sir I bleed 
GLOUCESTER  
Where is the villain Edmund 
EDMUND  
Fled this way sir When by no means he could  
GLOUCESTER  
Pursue him ho Go after
