 The question of Cordelia and her father 
Requires a fitter place 
ALBANY  
Sir by your patience 
I hold you but a subject of this war 
Not as a brother 
REGAN  
Thats as we list to grace him 
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded 
Ere you had spoke so far He led our powers 
Bore the commission of my place and person 
The which immediacy may well stand up 
And call itself your brother 
GONERIL  
Not so hot 
In his own grace he doth exalt himself 
More than in your addition 
REGAN  
In my rights 
By me invested he compeers the best 
GONERIL  
That were the most if he should husband you 
REGAN  
Jesters do oft prove prophets 
GONERIL  
Holla holla 
That eye that told you so lookd but asquint 
REGAN  
Lady I am not well else I should answer 
From a fullflowing stomach General 
Take thou my soldiers prisoners patrimony 
Dispose of them of me the walls are thine 
Witness the world that I create thee here 
My lord and master 
GONERIL  
Mean you to enjoy him 
ALBANY  
The letalone lies not in your good will 
EDMUND  
Nor in thine lord 
ALBANY
