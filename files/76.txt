 KING LEAR  
Then let them anatomize Regan see what breeds 
about her heart Is there any cause in nature that 
makes these hard hearts 
To EDGAR  
You sir I entertain for one of my hundred only I 
do not like the fashion of your garments you will 
say they are Persian attire but let them be changed 
KENT  
Now good my lord lie here and rest awhile 
KING LEAR  
Make no noise make no noise draw the curtains 
so so so Well go to supper i he morning So so so 
Fool  
And Ill go to bed at noon 
Reenter GLOUCESTER  
GLOUCESTER  
Come hither friend where is the king my master 
KENT  
Here sir but trouble him not his wits are gone 
GLOUCESTER  
Good friend I prithee take him in thy arms 
I have oerheard a plot of death upon him 
There is a litter ready lay him in t 
And drive towards Dover friend where thou shalt meet 
Both welcome and protection Take up thy master 
If thou shouldst dally half an hour his life 
With thine and all that offer to defend him 
Stand in assured loss take up take up 
And follow me that will to some provision 
Give thee quick conduct 
KENT  
Oppressed nature sleeps 
This rest might yet have balmd thy broken senses 
Which if convenience will not allow 
Stand in hard cure 
To the Fool
