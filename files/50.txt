 Winters not gone yet if the wildgeese fly that way 
Fathers that wear rags 
Do make their children blind 
But fathers that bear bags 
Shall see their children kind 
Fortune that arrant whore 
Neer turns the key to the poor 
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolours 
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year 
KING LEAR  
O how this mother swells up toward my heart 
Hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow 
Thy elements below Where is this daughter 
KENT  
With the earl sir here within 
KING LEAR  
Follow me not 
Stay here 
Exit 
Gentleman  
Made you no more offence but what you speak of 
KENT  
None 
How chance the king comes with so small a train 
Fool  
And thou hadst been set i the stocks for that 
question thou hadst well deserved it 
KENT  
Why fool 
Fool  
Well set thee to school to an ant to teach thee 
theres no labouring i the winter All that follow 
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and 
theres not a nose among twenty but can smell him 
thats stinking Let go thy hold when a great wheel 
runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with 
following it but the great one that goes up the 
hill let him draw thee after When a wise man 
gives thee better counsel give me mine again I 
would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
