 Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR  
EDGAR  
Before you fight the battle ope this letter 
If you have victory let the trumpet sound 
For him that brought it wretched though I seem 
I can produce a champion that will prove 
What is avouched there If you miscarry 
Your business of the world hath so an end 
And machination ceases Fortune love you 
ALBANY  
Stay till I have read the letter 
EDGAR  
I was forbid it 
When time shall serve let but the herald cry 
And Ill appear again 
ALBANY  
Why fare thee well I will oerlook thy paper 
Exit EDGAR  
Reenter EDMUND  
EDMUND  
The enemys in view draw up your powers 
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces 
By diligent discovery but your haste 
Is now urged on you 
ALBANY  
We will greet the time 
Exit 
EDMUND  
To both these sisters have I sworn my love 
Each jealous of the other as the stung 
Are of the adder Which of them shall I take 
Both one or neither Neither can be enjoyd 
If both remain alive to take the widow 
Exasperates makes mad her sister Goneril 
And hardly shall I carry out my side 
Her husband being alive Now then well use 
His countenance for the battle which being done 
Let her who would be rid of him devise
