7 
 When majesty stoops to folly Reverse thy doom 
And in thy best consideration cheque 
This hideous rashness answer my life my judgment 
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least 
Nor are those emptyhearted whose low sound 
Reverbs no hollowness 
KING LEAR  
Kent on thy life no more 
KENT  
My life I never held but as a pawn 
To wage against thy enemies nor fear to lose it 
Thy safety being the motive 
KING LEAR  
Out of my sight 
KENT  
See better Lear and let me still remain 
The true blank of thine eye 
KING LEAR  
Now by Apollo  
KENT  
Now by Apollo king 
Thou swearst thy gods in vain 
KING LEAR  
O vassal miscreant 
Laying his hand on his sword  
ALBANY  CORNWALL  
Dear sir forbear 
KENT  
Do 
Kill thy physician and the fee bestow 
Upon thy foul disease Revoke thy doom 
Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat 
Ill tell thee thou dost evil 
KING LEAR  
Hear me recreant 
On thine allegiance hear me 
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow 
Which we durst never yet and with straind pride 
To come between our sentence and our power 
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear
