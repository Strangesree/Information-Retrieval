Thy sheep shall take no harm

Arraign her first tis Goneril I here take my 
oath before this honourable assembly she kicked the 
poor king her father 
Fool

KING LEAR  
And heres another whose warpd looks proclaim 
What store her heart is made on Stop her there 
Arms arms sword fire Corruption in the place 
False justicer why hast thou let her scape 
EDGAR

KENT  
O pity Sir where is the patience now 
That thou so oft have boasted to retain 
EDGAR  
Aside My tears begin to take his part so much 
Theyll mar my counterfeiting 
KING LEAR  
The little dogs and all Tray Blanch and 
Sweetheart see they bark at me 
EDGAR  
Tom will throw his head at them Avaunt you curs 
Be thy mouth or black or white 
Tooth that poisons if it bite 
Mastiff greyhound mongrel grim 
Hound or spaniel brach or lym 
Or bobtail tike or trundletail 
Tom will make them weep and wail 
For with throwing thus my head 
Dogs leap the hatch and all are fled 
Do de de de Sessa Come march to wakes and 
fairs and markettowns Poor Tom thy horn is dry
