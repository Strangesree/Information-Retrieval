 If the matter were good my lord I durst swear 
it were his but in respect of that I would 
fain think it were not 
GLOUCESTER  
It is his 
EDMUND  
It is his hand my lord but I hope his heart is 
not in the contents 
GLOUCESTER  
Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business 
EDMUND  
Never my lord but I have heard him oft 
maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age 
and fathers declining the father should be as 
ward to the son and the son manage his revenue 
GLOUCESTER  
O villain villain His very opinion in the 
letter Abhorred villain Unnatural detested 
brutish villain worse than brutish Go sirrah 
seek him Ill apprehend him abominable villain 
Where is he 
EDMUND  
I do not well know my lord If it shall please 
you to suspend your indignation against my 
brother till you can derive from him better 
testimony of his intent you shall run a certain 
course where if you violently proceed against 
him mistaking his purpose it would make a great 
gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the 
heart of his obedience I dare pawn down my life 
for him that he hath wrote this to feel my 
affection to your honour and to no further 
pretence of danger 
GLOUCESTER  
Think you so 
EDMUND  
If your honour judge it meet I will place you 
where you shall hear us confer of this and by an 
auricular assurance have your satisfaction and 
that without any further delay than this very evening 
GLOUCESTER  
He cannot be such a monster
