 Strong and fastend villain 
Would he deny his letter I never got him 
Tucket within  
Hark the dukes trumpets I know not why he comes 
All ports Ill bar the villain shall not scape 
The duke must grant me that besides his picture 
I will send far and near that all the kingdom 
May have the due note of him and of my land 
Loyal and natural boy Ill work the means 
To make thee capable 
Enter CORNWALL REGAN and Attendants  
CORNWALL  
How now my noble friend since I came hither 
Which I can call but now I have heard strange news 
REGAN  
If it be true all vengeance comes too short 
Which can pursue the offender How dost my lord 
GLOUCESTER  
O madam my old heart is crackd its crackd 
REGAN  
What did my fathers godson seek your life 
He whom my father named your Edgar 
GLOUCESTER  
O lady lady shame would have it hid 
REGAN  
Was he not companion with the riotous knights 
That tend upon my father 
GLOUCESTER  
I know not madam tis too bad too bad 
EDMUND  
Yes madam he was of that consort 
REGAN  
No marvel then though he were ill affected 
Tis they have put him on the old mans death 
To have the expense and waste of his revenues 
I have this present evening from my sister 
Been well informd of them and with such cautions
