 Enter in conquest with drum and colours EDMUND KING LEAR and 
CORDELIA prisoners Captain Soldiers  c  
EDMUND  
Some officers take them away good guard 
Until their greater pleasures first be known 
That are to censure them 
CORDELIA  
We are not the first 
Who with best meaning have incurrd the worst 
For thee oppressed king am I cast down 
Myself could else outfrown false fortunes frown 
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters 
KING LEAR  
No no no no Come lets away to prison 
We two alone will sing like birds i the cage 
When thou dost ask me blessing Ill kneel down 
And ask of thee forgiveness so well live 
And pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh 
At gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues 
Talk of court news and well talk with them too 
Who loses and who wins whos in whos out 
And take upons the mystery of things 
As if we were Gods spies and well wear out 
In a walld prison packs and sects of great ones 
That ebb and flow by the moon 
EDMUND  
Take them away 
KING LEAR  
Upon such sacrifices my Cordelia 
The gods themselves throw incense Have I caught thee 
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven 
And fire us hence like foxes Wipe thine eyes 
The goodyears shall devour them flesh and fell 
Ere they shall make us weep well see em starve 
first Come 
Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA guarded  
EDMUND  
Come hither captain hark 
Take thou this note
