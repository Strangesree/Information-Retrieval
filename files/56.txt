 I pray you father being weak seem so 
If till the expiration of your month 
You will return and sojourn with my sister 
Dismissing half your train come then to me 
I am now from home and out of that provision 
Which shall be needful for your entertainment 
KING LEAR  
Return to her and fifty men dismissd 
No rather I abjure all roofs and choose 
To wage against the enmity o the air 
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl  
Necessitys sharp pinch Return with her 
Why the hotblooded France that dowerless took 
Our youngest born I could as well be brought 
To knee his throne and squirelike pension beg 
To keep base life afoot Return with her 
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter 
To this detested groom 
Pointing at OSWALD  
GONERIL  
At your choice sir 
KING LEAR  
I prithee daughter do not make me mad 
I will not trouble thee my child farewell 
Well no more meet no more see one another 
But yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter 
Or rather a disease thats in my flesh 
Which I must needs call mine thou art a boil 
A plaguesore an embossed carbuncle 
In my corrupted blood But Ill not chide thee 
Let shame come when it will I do not call it 
I do not bid the thunderbearer shoot 
Nor tell tales of thee to highjudging Jove 
Mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure 
I can be patient I can stay with Regan 
I and my hundred knights 
REGAN  
Not altogether so 
I lookd not for you yet nor am provided 
For your fit welcome Give ear sir to my sister 
For those that mingle reason with your passion
