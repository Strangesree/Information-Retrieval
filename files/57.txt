 Must be content to think you old and so  
But she knows what she does 
KING LEAR  
Is this well spoken 
REGAN  
I dare avouch it sir what fifty followers 
Is it not well What should you need of more 
Yea or so many sith that both charge and danger 
Speak gainst so great a number How in one house 
Should many people under two commands 
Hold amity Tis hard almost impossible 
GONERIL  
Why might not you my lord receive attendance 
From those that she calls servants or from mine 
REGAN  
Why not my lord If then they chanced to slack you 
We could control them If you will come to me  
For now I spy a danger I entreat you 
To bring but five and twenty to no more 
Will I give place or notice 
KING LE AR 
I gave you all  
REGAN  
And in good time you gave it 
KING LEAR  
Made you my guardians my depositaries 
But kept a reservation to be followd 
With such a number What must I come to you 
With five and twenty Regan said you so 
REGAN  
And speakt again my lord no more with me 
KING LEAR  
Those wicked creatures yet do look wellfavourd 
When others are more wicked not being the worst 
Stands in some rank of praise 
To GONERIL  
Ill go with thee 
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty 
And thou art twice her love
