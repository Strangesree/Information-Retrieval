 Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy 
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me 
Bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind 
Thou losest here a better where to find 
KING LEAR  
Thou hast her France let her be thine for we 
Have no such daughter nor shall ever see 
That face of hers again Therefore be gone 
Without our grace our love our benison 
Come noble Burgundy 
Flourish Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE GONERIL REGAN and CORDELIA  
KING OF FRANCE  
Bid farewell to your sisters 
CORDELIA  
The jewels of our father with washd eyes 
Cordelia leaves you I know you what you are 
And like a sister am most loath to call 
Your faults as they are named Use well our father 
To your professed bosoms I commit him 
But yet alas stood I within his grace 
I would prefer him to a better place 
So farewell to you both 
REGAN  
Prescribe not us our duties 
GONERIL  
Let your study 
Be to content your lord who hath received you 
At fortunes alms You have obedience scanted 
And well are worth the want that you have wanted 
CORDELIA  
Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides 
Who cover faults at last shame them derides 
Well may you prosper 
KING OF FRANCE  
Come my fair Cordelia 
Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDEL IA 
GONERIL
