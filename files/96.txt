 The fishermen that walk upon the beach 
Appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark 
Diminishd to her cock her cock a buoy 
Almost too small for sight the murmuring surge 
That on the unnumberd idle pebbles chafes 
Cannot be heard so high Ill look no more 
Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight 
Topple down headlong 
GLOUCESTER  
Set me where you stand 
EDGAR  
Give me your hand you are now within a foot 
Of the extreme verge for all beneath the moon 
Would I not leap upright 
GLOUCESTER  
Let go my hand 
Here friend s another purse in it a jewel 
Well worth a poor mans taking fairies and gods 
Prosper it with thee Go thou farther off 
Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going 
EDGAR  
Now fare you well good sir 
GLOUCESTER  
With all my heart 
EDGAR  
Why I do trifle thus with his despair 
Is done to cure it 
GLOUCESTER  
Kneeling O you mighty gods 
This world I do renounce and in your sights 
Shake patiently my great affliction off 
If I could bear it longer and not fall 
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills 
My snuff and loathed part of nature should 
Burn itself out If Edgar live O bless him 
Now fellow fare thee well 
He falls forward  
EDGAR  
Gone sir farewell 
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
