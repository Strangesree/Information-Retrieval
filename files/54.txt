 Age is unnecessary on my knees I beg 
That youll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food 
REGAN  
Good sir no more these are unsightly tricks 
Return you to my sister 
KING LEAR  
Rising Never Regan 
She hath abated me of half my train 
Lookd black upon me struck me with her tongue 
Most serpentlike upon the very heart 
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall 
On her ingrateful top Strike her young bones 
You taking airs with lameness 
CORNWALL  
Fie sir fie 
KING LEAR  
You nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames 
Into her scornful eyes Infect her beauty 
You fensuckd fogs drawn by the powerful sun 
To fall and blast her pride 
REGAN  
O the blest gods so will you wish on me 
When the rash mood is on 
KING LEAR  
No Regan thou shalt never have my curse 
Thy tenderhefted nature shall not give 
Thee oer to harshness her eyes are fierce but thine 
Do comfort and not burn Tis not in thee 
To grudge my pleasures to cut off my train 
To bandy hasty words to scant my sizes 
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt 
Against my coming in thou better knowst 
The offices of nature bond of childhood 
Effects of courtesy dues of gratitude 
Thy half o the kingdom hast thou not forgot 
Wherein I thee endowd 
REGAN  
Good sir to the purpose 
KING LEAR  
Who put my man i the stocks 
Tucket within
