 And false 
CORNWALL  
Where hast thou sent the king 
GLOUCESTER  
To Dover 
REGAN  
Wherefore to Dover Wast thou not charged at peril  
CORNWALL  
Wherefore to Dover Let him first answer that 
GLOUCESTER  
I am tied to the stake and I must stand the course 
REGAN  
Wherefore to Dover sir 
GLOUCESTER  
Because I would not see thy cruel nails 
Pluck out his poor old eyes nor thy fierce sister 
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs 
The sea with such a storm as his bare head 
In hellblack night endured would have buoyd up 
And quenchd the stelled fires 
Yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain 
If wolves had at thy gate howld that stern time 
Thou shouldst have said Good porter turn the key 
All cruels else subscribed but I shall see 
The winged vengeance overtake such children 
CORNWALL  
Seet shalt thou never Fellows hold the chair 
Upon these eyes of thine Ill set my foot 
GLOUCESTER  
He that will think to live till he be old 
Give me some help O cruel O you gods 
REGAN  
One side will mock another the other too 
CORNWALL  
If you see vengeance  
First Servant  
Hold your hand my lord 
I have served you ever since I was a child 
But better service have I never done you 
Than now to bid you hold
