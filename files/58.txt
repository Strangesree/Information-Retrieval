 GONERIL  
Hear me my lord 
What need you five and twenty ten or five 
To follow in a house where twice so many 
Have a command to tend you 
REGAN  
What need one 
KING LEAR  
O reason not the need our basest beggars 
Are in the poorest thing superfluous 
Allow not nature more than nature needs 
Mans lifes as cheap as beasts thou art a lady 
If only to go warm were gorgeous 
Why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wearst 
Which scarcely keeps thee warm But for true need  
You heavens give me that patience patience I need 
You see me here you gods a poor old man 
As full of grief as age wretched in both 
If it be you that stir these daughters hearts 
Against their father fool me not so much 
To bear it tamely touch me with noble anger 
And let not womens weapons waterdrops 
Stain my mans cheeks No you unnatural hags 
I will have such revenges on you both 
That all the world shall I will do such things  
What they are yet I know not but they shall be 
The terrors of the earth You think Ill weep 
No Ill not weep 
I have full cause of weeping but this heart 
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws 
Or ere Ill weep O fool I shall go mad 
Exeunt KING LEAR GLOUCESTER KENT and Fool  
Storm and tempest  
CORNWALL  
Let us withdraw twill be a storm 
REGAN  
This house is little the old man and his people 
Cannot be well bestowd 
GONERIL
