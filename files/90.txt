 Ay my good lord twas he informd against him 
And quit the house on purpose that their punishment 
Might have the freer course

And to revenge thine eyes Come hither friend

SCENE III The French camp near Dover 
Enter KENT and a Gentleman  
KENT  
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back 
know you the reason 
Gentleman  
Something he left imperfect in the 
state which since his coming forth is thought 
of which imports to the kingdom so much 
fear and danger that his personal return was 
most required and necessary 
KENT  
Who hath he left behind him general 
Gentleman  
The Marshal of France Monsieur La Far 
KENT  
Did your letters pierce the queen to any 
demonstration of grief 
Gentleman  
Ay sir she took them read them in my presence 
And now and then an ample tear trilld down 
Her delicate cheek it seemd she was a queen 
Over her passion who most rebellike 
Sought to be king oer her 
KENT  
O then it moved her 
Gentleman  
Not to a rage patience and sorrow strove 
Who should express her goodliest You have seen 
Sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
