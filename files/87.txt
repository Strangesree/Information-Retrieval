 Shall pass between us ere long you are like to hear 
If you dare venture in your own behalf 
A mistresss command Wear this spare speech 
Giving a favour  
Decline your head this kiss if it durst speak 
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air 
Conceive and fare thee well 
EDMUND  
Yours in the ranks of death 
GONERIL  
My most dear Gloucester 
Exit EDMUND  
O the difference of man and man 
To thee a womans services are due 
My fool usurps my body 
OSWALD  
Madam here comes my lord 
Exit 
Enter ALBANY  
GONERIL  
I have been worth the whistle 
ALBANY  
O Goneril 
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind 
Blows in your face I fear your disposition 
That nature which contemns its origin 
Cannot be borderd certain in itself 
She that herself will sliver and disbranch 
From her material sap perforce must wither 
And come to deadly use 
GONERIL  
No more the text is foolish 
ALBANY  
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile 
Filths savour but themselves What have you done 
Tigers not daughters what have you performd
