86 
 Ay master 
GLOUCESTER  
There is a cliff whose high and bending head 
Looks fearfully in the confined deep 
Bring me but to the very brim of it 
And Ill repair the misery thou dost bear 
With something rich about me from that place 
I shall no leading need 
EDGAR  
Give me thy arm 
Poor Tom shall lead thee 
Exeunt  
SCENE II Before ALBANYs palace 
Enter GONERIL and EDMUND  
GONERIL  
Welcome my lord I marvel our mild husband 
Not met us on the way 
Enter OSWALD  
Now wheres your master 
OSWALD  
Madam within but never man so changed 
I told him of the army that was landed 
He smiled at it I told him you were coming 
His answer was The worse of Gloucesters treachery 
And of the loyal service of his son 
When I informd him then he calld me sot 
And told me I had turnd the wrong side out 
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him 
What like offensive 
GONERIL  
To EDMUND Then shall you go no further 
It is the cowish terror of his spirit 
That dares not undertake hell not feel wrongs 
Which tie him to an answer Our wishes on the way 
May prove effects Back Edmund to my brother 
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers 
I must change arms at home and give the distaff 
Into my husbands hands This trusty servant
