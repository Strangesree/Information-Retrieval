Sir I thought it fit 
To send the old and miserable king 
To some retention and appointed guard 
Whose age has charms in it whose title more

Where you shall hold your session At this time 
We sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend 
And the best quarrels in the heat are cursed 
By those that feel their sharpness
