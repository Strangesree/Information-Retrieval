 And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes 
What safe and nicely I might well delay 
By rule of knighthood I disdain and spurn 
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head 
With the hellhated lie oerwhelm thy heart 
Which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise 
This sword of mine shall give them instant way 
Where they shall rest for ever Trumpets speak 
Alarums They fight EDMUND falls  
ALBANY  
Save him save him 
GONERIL  
This is practise Gloucester 
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer 
An unknown opposite thou art not vanquishd 
But cozend and beguiled 
ALBANY  
Shut your mouth dame 
Or with this paper shall I stop it Hold sir 
Thou worse than any name read thine own evil 
No tearing lady I perceive you know it 
Gives the letter to EDMUND  
GONERIL  
Say if I do the laws are mine not thine 
Who can arraign me fort 
ALBANY  
Most monstrous oh 
Knowst thou this paper 
GONERIL  
Ask me not what I know 
Exit 
ALBANY  
Go after her shes desperate govern her 
EDMUND  
What you have charged me with that have I done 
And more much more the time will bring it out 
Tis past and so am I But what art thou
