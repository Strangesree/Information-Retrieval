 Whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves 
When nature being oppressd commands the mind 
To suffer with the body Ill forbear 
And am falln out with my more headier will 
To take the indisposed and sickly fit 
For the sound man Death on my state wherefore 
Looking on KENT  
Should he sit here This act persuades me 
That this remotion of the duke and her 
Is practise only Give me my servant forth 
Go tell the duke and s wife Ild speak with them 
Now presently bid them come forth and hear me 
Or at their chamberdoor Ill beat the drum 
Till it cry sleep to death 
GLOUCESTER  
I would have all well betwixt you 
Exit 
KING LEAR  
O me my heart my rising heart but down 
Fool  
Cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels 
when she put em i the paste alive she knapped em 
o the coxcombs with a stick and cried Down 
wantons down Twas her brother that in pure 
kindness to his horse buttered his hay 
Enter CORNWALL REGAN GLOUCESTER and Servants  
KING LEAR  
Good morrow to you both 
CORNWALL  
Hail to your grace 
KENT is set at liberty  
REGAN  
I am glad to see your highness 
KING LEAR  
Regan I think you are I know what reason 
I have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad
