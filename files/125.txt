 If that her breath will mist or stain the stone 
Why then she lives 
KENT  
Is this the promised end 
EDGAR  
Or image of that horror 
ALBANY  
Fall and cease 
KING LEAR  
This feather stirs she lives if it be so 
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows 
That ever I have felt 
KENT  
Kneeling O my good master 
KING LEAR  
Prithee away 
EDGAR  
Tis noble Kent your friend 
KING LEAR  
A plague upon you murderers traitors all 
I might have saved her now shes gone for ever 
Cordelia Cordelia stay a little Ha 
What ist thou sayst Her voice was ever soft 
Gentle and low an excellent thing in woman 
I killd the slave that was ahanging thee 
Captain  
Tis true my lords he did 
KING LEAR  
Did I not fellow 
I have seen the day with my good biting falchion 
I would have made them skip I am old now 
And these same crosses spoil me Who are you 
Mine eyes are not o the best Ill tell you straight 
KENT  
If fortune brag of two she loved and hated 
One of them we behold 
KING LEAR  
This is a dull sight Are you not Kent 
KENT
