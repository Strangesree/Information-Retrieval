 KING LEAR  
Nothing 
CORDELIA  
Nothing 
KING LEAR  
Nothing will come of nothing speak again 
CORDELIA  
Unhappy that I am I cannot heave 
My heart into my mouth I love your majesty 
According to my bond nor more nor less 
KING LEAR  
How how Cordelia mend your speech a little 
Lest it may mar your fortunes 
CORDELIA  
Good my lord 
You have begot me bred me loved me I 
Return those duties back as are right fit 
Obey you love you and most honour you 
Why have my sisters husbands if they say 
They love you all Haply when I shall wed 
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry 
Half my love with him half my care and duty 
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters 
To love my father all 
KING LEAR  
But goes thy heart with this 
CORDELIA  
Ay good my lord 
KING LEAR  
So young and so untender 
CORDELIA  
So young my lord and true 
KING LEAR  
Let it be so thy truth then be thy dower 
For by the sacred radiance of the sun 
The mysteries of Hecate and the night 
By all the operation of the orbs 
From whom we do exist and cease to be 
Here I disclaim all my paternal care 
Propinquity and property of blood 
And as a stranger to my heart and me
