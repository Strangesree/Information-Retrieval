 Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest 
And must needs taste his folly 
REGAN  
For his particular Ill receive him gladly 
But not one follower 
GONERIL  
So am I purposed 
Where is my lord of Gloucester 
CORNWALL  
Followd the old man forth he is returnd 
Reenter GLOUCESTER  
GLOUCESTER  
The king is in high rage 
CORNWALL  
Whither is he going 
GLOUCESTER  
He calls to horse but will I know not whither 
CORNWALL  
Tis best to give him way he leads himself 
GONERIL  
My lord entreat him by no means to stay 
GLOUCESTER  
Alack the night comes on and the bleak winds 
Do sorely ruffle for many miles a bout 
Theres scarce a bush 
REGAN  
O sir to wilful men 
The injuries that they themselves procure 
Must be their schoolmasters Shut up your doors 
He is attended with a desperate train 
And what they may incense him to being apt 
To have his ear abused wisdom bids fear 
CORNWALL  
Shut up your doors my lord tis a wild night 
My Regan counsels well come out o the storm 
Exeunt
