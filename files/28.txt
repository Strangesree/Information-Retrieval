 By your allowance which if you should the fault 
Would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep 
Which in the tender of a wholesome weal 
Might in their working do you that offence 
Which else were shame that then necessity 
Will call discreet proceeding 
Fool  
For you trow nuncle 
The hedgesparrow fed the cuckoo so long 
That its had it head bit off by it young 
So out went the candle and we were left darkling 
KING LEAR  
Are you our daughter 
GONERIL  
Come sir 
I would you would make use of that good wisdom 
Whereof I know you are fraught and put away 
These dispositions that of late transform you 
From what you rightly are 
Fool  
May not an ass know when the cart 
draws the horse Whoop Jug I love thee 
KING LEAR  
Doth any here know me This is not Lear 
Doth Lear walk thus speak thus Where are his eyes 
Either his notion weakens his discernings 
Are lethargied Ha waking tis not so 
Who is it that can tell me who I am 
Fool  
Lears shadow 
KING LEAR  
I would learn that for by the 
marks of sovereignty knowledge and reason 
I should be false persuaded I had daughters 
Fool  
Which they will make an obedient father 
KING LEAR  
Your name fair gentlewoman 
GONERIL  
This admiration sir is much o the savour 
Of other your new pranks I do beseech you
