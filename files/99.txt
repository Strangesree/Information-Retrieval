 beard ere the black ones were there To say ay 
and no to every thing that I said Ay and no 
too was no good divinity When the rain came to 
wet me once and the wind to make me chatter when 
the thunder would not peace at my bidding there I 
found em there I smelt em out Go to they are 
not men o their words they told me I was every

GLOUCESTER  
The trick of that voice I do well remember 
Is t not the king 
KING LEAR  
Ay every inch a king 
When I do stare see how the subject quakes 
I pardon that mans life What was thy cause Adultery 
Thou shalt not die die for adultery No 
The wren goes to t and the small gilded fly 
Does lecher in my sight 
Let copulation thrive for Gloucesters bastard son 
Was kinder to his father than my daughters 
Got tween the lawful sheets 
To t luxury pellmell for I lack soldiers 
Behold yond simpering dame 
Whose face between her forks presages snow 
That minces virtue and does shake the head 
To hear of pleasures name 
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to t 
With a more riotous appetite 
Down from the waist they are Centaurs 
Though women all above 
But to the girdle do the gods inherit 
Beneath is all the fiends 
Theres hell theres darkness theres the 
sulphurous p it 
Burning scalding stench consumption fie 
fie fie pah pah Give me an ounce of civet 
good apothecary to sweeten my imagination 
theres money for thee 
GLOUCESTER  
O let me kiss that hand 
KING LEAR  
Let me wipe it first it smells of mortality
