 Fool  
Singing 
He that has and a little tiny wit  
With hey ho the wind and the rain  
Must make content with his fortunes fit 
For the rain it raineth every day 
KING LEAR  
True my good boy Come bring us to this hovel 
Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT  
Fool  
This is a brave night to cool a courtezan 
Ill speak a prophecy ere I go 
When priests are more in word than matter 
When brewers mar their malt with water 
When nobles are their tailors tutors 
No heretics burnd but wenches suitors 
When every case in law is right 
No squire in debt nor no poor knight 
When slanders do not live in tongues 
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs 
When usurers tell their gold i the field 
And bawds and whores do churches build 
Then shall the realm of Albion 
Come to great confusion 
Then comes the time who lives to seet 
That going shall be used with feet 
This prophecy Merlin shall make for I live before his time 
Exit 
SCENE III Gloucesters castle 
Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND  
GLOUCESTER  
Alack alack Edmund I like not this unnatural 
dealing When I desire their leave that I might 
pity him they took from me the use of mine own 
house charged me on pain of their perpetual 
displeasure neither to speak of him entreat for 
him nor any way sustain him 
EDMUND  
Most savage and unnatural
