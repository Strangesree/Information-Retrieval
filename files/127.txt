 Have more than merited All friends shall taste 
The wages of their virtue and all foes 
The cup of their deservings O see see 
KING LEAR  
And my poor fool is hangd No no no life 
Why should a dog a horse a rat have life 
And thou no breath at all Thoult come no more 
Never never never never never 
Pray you undo this button thank you sir 
Do you see this Look on her look her lips 
Look there look there 
Dies 
EDGAR  
He faints My lord my lord 
KENT  
Break heart I prithee break 
EDGAR  
Look up my lord 
KENT  
Vex not his ghost O let him pass he hates him much 
That would upon the rack of this tough world 
Stretch him out longer 
EDGAR  
He is gone indeed 
KENT  
The wonder is he hath endured so long 
He but usurpd his life 
ALBANY  
Bear them from hence Our present business 
Is general woe 
To KENT and EDGAR  
Friends of my soul you twain 
Rule in this realm and the gored state sustain 
KENT  
I have a journey sir shortly to go 
My master calls me I must not say no 
ALBANY
