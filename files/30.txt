 That like an engine wrenchd my frame of nature 
From the fixd place drew from heart all love 
And added to the gall O Lear Lear Lear 
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in 
Striking his head  
And thy dear judgment out Go go my people 
ALBANY  
My lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant 
Of what hath moved you 
KING LEAR  
It may be so my lord 
Hear nature hear dear goddess hear 
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend 
To make this creature fruitful 
Into her womb convey sterility 
Dry up in her the organs of increase 
And from her derogate body never spring 
A babe to honour her If she must teem 
Create her child of spleen that it may live 
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her 
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth 
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks 
Turn all her mothers pains and benefits 
To laughter and contempt that she may feel 
How sharper than a serpents tooth it is 
To have a thankless child Away away 
Exit 
ALBANY  
Now gods that we adore whereof comes this 
GONERIL  
Never afflict yourself to know the cause 
But let his disposition have that scope 
That dotage gives it 
Reenter KING LEAR  
KING LEAR  
What fifty of my followers at a clap 
Within a fortnight 
ALBANY
