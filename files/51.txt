 That sir which serves and seeks for gain 
And follows but for form 
Will pack when it begins to rain 
And leave thee in the storm 
But I will tarry the fool will stay 
And let the wise man fly 
The knave turns fool that runs away 
The fool no knave perdy 
KENT  
Where learned you this fool 
Fool  
Not i the stocks fool 
Reenter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER  
KING LEAR  
Deny to speak with me They are sick they are weary 
They have travelld all the night Mere fetches 
The images of revolt and flying off 
Fetch me a better answer 
GLOUCESTER  
My dear lord 
You know the fiery quality of the duke 
How unremoveable and fixd he is 
In his own course 
KING LEAR  
Vengeance plague death confusion 
Fiery what quality Why Gloucester Gloucester 
Ild speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife 
GLOUCESTER  
Well my good lord I have informd them so 
KING LEAR  
Informd them Dost thou understand me man 
GLOUCESTER  
Ay my good lord 
KING LEAR  
The king would speak with Cornwall the dear father 
Would with his daughter speak commands her service 
Are they informd of this My breath and blood 
Fiery the fiery duke Tell the hot duke that  
No but not yet may be he is not well 
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
