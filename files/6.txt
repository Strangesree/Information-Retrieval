 Hold thee from this for ever The barbarous Scythian 
Or he that makes his generation messes 
To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom 
Be as well neighbourd pitied and relieved 
As thou my sometime daughter 
KENT  
Good my liege  
KING LEAR  
Peace Kent 
Come not between the dragon and his wrath 
I loved her most and thought to set my rest 
On her kind nursery Hence and avoid my sight 
So be my grave my peace as here I give 
Her fathers heart from her Call France who stirs 
Call Burgundy Cornwall and Albany 
With my two daughters dowers digest this third 
Let pride which she calls plainness marry her 
I do invest you jointly with my power 
Preeminence and all the large effects 
That troop with majesty Ourself by monthly course 
With reservation of an hundred knights 
By you to be sustaind shall our abode 
Make with you by due turns Only we still retain 
The name and all the additions to a king 
The sway revenue execution of the rest 
Beloved sons be yours which to confirm 
This coronet part betwixt you 
Giving the crown  
KENT  
Royal Lear 
Whom I have ever honourd as my king 
Loved as my father as my master followd 
As my great patron thought on in my prayers  
KING LEAR  
The bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft 
KENT  
Let it fall rather though the fork invade 
The region of my heart be Kent unmannerly 
When Lear is mad What wilt thou do old man 
Thinkst thou that duty shall have dread to speak 
When power to flattery bows To plainness honours bound
