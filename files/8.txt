 Our potency made good take thy reward 
Five days we do allot thee for provision 
To shield thee from diseases of the world 
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back 
Upon our kingdom if on the tenth day following 
Thy banishd trunk be found in our dominions 
The moment is thy death Away by Jupiter

That good effects may spring from words of love 
Thus Kent O princes bids you all adieu 
Hell shape his old course in a country new
