 ACT III 
SCENE I A heath 
Storm still Enter KENT and a Gentleman meeting  
KENT  
Whos there besides foul weather 
Gentleman  
One minded like the weather most unquietly 
KENT  
I know you Wheres the king 
Gentleman  
Contending with the fretful element 
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea 
Or swell the curled water bove the main 
That things might change or cease tears his white hair 
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage 
Catch in their fury and make nothing of 
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn 
The toandfroconflicting wind and rain 
This night wherein the cubdrawn bear would couch 
The lion and the bellypinched wolf 
Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs 
And bids what will take all 
KENT  
But who is with him 
Gentleman  
None but the fool who labours to outjest 
His heartstruck injuries 
KENT  
Sir I do know you 
And dare upon the warrant of my note 
Commend a dear thing to you There is division 
Although as yet the face of it be coverd 
With mutual cunning twixt Albany and Cornwall 
Who have as who have not that their great stars 
Throned and set high servants who seem no less 
Which are to France the spies and speculations 
Intelligent of our state what hath been seen 
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes 
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne 
Against the old kind king or something deeper
