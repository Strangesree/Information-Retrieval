But true it is from France there comes a power 
Into this scatterd kingdom who already 
Wise in our negligence have secret feet 
In some of our best ports and are at point 
To show their open banner Now to you 
If on my credit you dare build so far 
To make your speed to Dover you shall find 
Some that will thank you making just report 
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow

This office to you

For confirmation that I am much more 
Than my outwall open this purse and take 
What it contains If you shall see Cordelia  
As fear not but you shall show her this ring

That yet you do not know Fie on this storm 
I will go seek the king 
Gentleman

That when we have found the king in which your pain 
That way Ill this he that first lights on him

Enter KING LEAR and Fool  
KING LEAR  
Blow winds and crack your cheeks rage blow 
You cataracts and hurricanoes spout 
Till you have drenchd our steeples drownd the cocks 
You sulphurous and thoughtexecuting fires
