 Of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices 
Strike in their numbd and mortified bare arms 
Pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary 
And with this horrible object from low farms 
Poor pelting villages sheepcotes and mills 
Sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers 
Enforce their charity Poor Turlygod poor Tom 
Thats something yet Edgar I nothing am
