 Dost thou call me fool boy 
Fool  
All thy other titles thou hast given away that 
thou wast born with 
KENT  
This is not altogether fool my lord 
Fool  
No faith lords and great men will not let me if 
I had a monopoly out they would have part ont 
and ladies too they will not let me have all fool 
to myself theyll be snatching Give me an egg 
nuncle and Ill give thee two crowns 
KING LEAR  
What two crowns shall they be 
Fool  
Why after I have cut the egg i the middle and eat 
up the meat the two crowns of the egg When thou 
clovest thy crown i the middle and gavest away 
both parts thou borest thy ass on thy back oer 
the dirt thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown 
when thou gavest thy golden one away If I speak 
like myself in this let him be whipped that first 
finds it so 
Singi ng 
Fools had neer less wit in a year 
For wise men are grown foppish 
They know not how their wits to wear 
Their manners are so apish 
KING LEAR  
When were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah 
Fool  
I have used it nuncle ever since thou madest thy 
daughters thy mothers for when thou gavest them 
the rod and putst down thine own breeches 
Singing  
Then they for sudden joy did weep 
And I for sorrow sung 
That such a king should play bopeep 
And go the fools among
