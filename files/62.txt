 Vauntcouriers to oakcleaving thunderbolts 
Singe my white head And thou allshaking thunder 
Smite flat the thick rotundity o the world 
Crack natures moulds an germens spill at once 
That make ingrateful man 
Fool  
O nuncle court holywater in a dry 
house is better than this rainwater out o door 
Good nuncle in and ask thy daughters blessing 
heres a night pities neither wise man nor fool 
KING LEAR  
Rumble thy bellyful Spit fire spout rain 
Nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters 
I tax not you you elements with unkindness 
I never gave you kingdom calld you children 
You owe me no subscription then let fall 
Your horrible pleasure here I stand your slave 
A poor infirm weak and despised old man 
But yet I call you servile ministers 
That have with two pernicious daughters joind 
Your high engenderd battles gainst a head 
So old and white as this O O tis foul 
Fool  
He that has a house to puts head in has a good 
headpiece 
The codpiece that will house 
Before the head has any 
The head and he shall louse 
So beggars marry many 
The man that makes his toe 
What he his heart should make 
Shall of a corn cry woe 
And turn his sleep to wake 
For there was never yet fair woman but she made 
mouths in a glass 
KING LEAR  
No I will be the pattern of all patience 
I will say nothing 
Enter KENT
