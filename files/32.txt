 Exit 
GONERIL  
This man hath had good counsel a hundred knights 
Tis politic and safe to let him keep 
At point a hundred knights yes that on every dream 
Each buzz each fancy each complaint dislike 
He may enguard his dotage with their powers 
And hold our lives in mercy Oswald I say 
ALBANY  
Well you may fear too far 
GONERIL  
Safer than trust too far 
Let me still take away the harms I fear 
Not fear still to be taken I know his heart 
What he hath utterd I have writ my sister 
If she sustain him and his hundred knights 
When I have showd the unfitness  
Reenter OSWALD  
How now Oswald 
What have you writ that letter to my sister 
OSWALD  
Yes madam 
GONERIL  
Take you some company and away to horse 
Inform her full of my particular fear 
And thereto add such reasons of your own 
As may compact it more Get you gone 
And hasten your return 
Exit OSWALD  
No no my lord 
This milky gentleness and course of yours 
Though I condemn not yet under pardon 
You are much more attaskd for want of wisdom 
Than praised for harmful mildness 
ALBANY  
How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell 
Striving to better oft we mar whats well 
GONERIL
