 Prithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach 
thy fool to lie I would fain learn to lie 
KING LEAR  
An you lie sirrah well have you whipped 
Fool  
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are 
theyll have me whipped for speaking true thoult 
have me whipped for lying and sometimes I am 
whipped for holding my peace I had rather be any 
kind o thing than a fool and yet I would not be 
thee nuncle thou hast pared thy wit o both sides 
and left nothing i the middle here comes one o 
the parings 
Enter GONERIL  
KING LEAR  
How now daughter what makes that frontlet on 
Methinks you are too much of late i the frown 
Fool  
Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to 
care for her frowning now thou art an O without a 
figure I am better than thou art now I am a fool 
thou art nothing 
To GONERIL  
Yes forsooth I will hold my tongue so your face 
bids me though you say nothing Mum mum 
He that keeps nor crust nor crum 
Weary of all shall want some 
Pointing to KING LEAR  
Thats a shealed peascod 
GONERIL  
Not only sir this your alllicensed fool 
But other of your insolent retinue 
Do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth 
In rank and not tobe endured riots Sir 
I had thought by making this well known unto you 
To have found a safe redress but now grow fearful 
By what yourself too late have spoke and done 
That you protect this course and put it on
