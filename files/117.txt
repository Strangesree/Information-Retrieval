 Halfblooded fellow yes 
REGAN  
To EDMUND Let the drum strike and prove my title thine 
ALBANY  
Stay yet hear reason Edmund I arrest thee 
On capital treason and in thine attaint 
This gilded serpent 
Pointing to Goneril  
For your claim fair sister 
I bar it in the interest of my wife 
Tis she is subcontracted to this lord 
And I her husband contradict your bans 
If you will marry make your loves to me 
My lady is bespoke 
GONERIL  
An interlude 
ALBANY  
Thou art armd Gloucester let the trumpet sound 
If none appear to prove upon thy head 
Thy heinous manifest and many treasons 
There is my pledge 
Throwing down a glove  
Ill prove it on thy heart 
Ere I taste bread thou art in nothing less 
Than I have here proclaimd thee 
REGAN  
Sick O sick

Throwing down a glove

That names me traitor villainlike he lies 
Call by thy trumpet he that dares approach 
On him on you who not I will maintain 
My truth and honour firmly
