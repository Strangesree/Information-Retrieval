97 
 The treasury of life when life itself 
Yields to the theft had he been where he thought 
By this had thought been past Alive or dead 
Ho you sir friend Hear you sir speak 
Thus might he pass indeed yet he revives 
What are you sir 
GLOUCESTER  
Away and let me die 
EDGAR  
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air 
So many fathom down precipitating 
Thoudst shiverd like an egg but thou dost breathe 
Hast heavy substance bleedst not speakst art sound 
Ten masts at each make not the altitude 
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell 
Thy lifes a miracle Speak yet again 
GLOUCESTER  
But have I falln or no 
EDGAR  
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn 
Look up aheight the shrillgorged lark so far 
Cannot be seen or heard do but look up 
GLOUCESTER  
Alack I have no eyes 
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit 
To end itself by death Twas yet some comfort 
When misery could beguile the tyrants rage 
And frustrate his proud will 
EDGAR  
Give me your arm 
Up so How is t Feel you your legs You stand 
GLOUCESTER  
Too well too well 
EDGAR  
This is above all strangeness 
Upon the crown o the cliff what thing was that 
Which parted from you 
GLOUCESTER  
A poor unfortunate beggar 
EDGAR
