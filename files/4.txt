 Sir I love you more than words can wield the matter 
Dearer than eyesight space and liberty 
Beyond what can be valued rich or rare 
No less than life with grace health beauty honour 
As much as child eer loved or father found 
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable 
Beyond all manner of so much I love you 
CORDELIA  
Aside What shall Cordelia do 
Love and be silent 
LEAR  
Of all these bounds even from this line to this 
With shadowy forests and with champains richd 
With plenteous rivers and wideskirted meads 
We make thee lady to thine and Albanys issue 
Be this perpetual What says our second daughter 
Our dearest Regan wife to Cornwall Speak 
REGAN  
Sir I am made 
Of the selfsame metal that my sister is 
And prize me at her worth In my true heart 
I find she names my very deed of love 
Only she comes too short that I profess 
Myself an enemy to all other joys 
Which the most precious square of sense possesses 
And find I am alone felicitate 
In your dear highness love 
CORDELIA  
Aside Then poor Cordelia 
And yet not so since I am sure my loves 
More richer than my tongue 
KING LEAR  
To thee and thine hereditary ever 
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom 
No less in space validity and pleasure 
Than that conferrd on Goneril Now our joy 
Although the last not least to whose young love 
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy 
Strive to be interessd what can you say to draw 
A third more opulent than your sisters Speak 
CORDELIA  
Nothing my lord
