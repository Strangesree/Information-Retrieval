 I would divorce me from thy mothers tomb 
Sepulchring an adultress 
To KENT  
O are you free 
Some other time for that Beloved Regan 
Thy sisters naught O Regan she hath tied 
Sharptoothd unkindness like a vulture here 
Points to his heart  
I can scarce speak to thee thoult not believe 
With how depraved a quality O Regan 
REGAN  
I pray you sir take patience I have hope 
You less know how to value her dese rt 
Than she to scant her duty 
KING LEAR  
Say how is that 
REGAN  
I cannot think my sister in the least 
Would fail her obligation if sir perchance 
She have restraind the riots of your followers 
Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end 
As clears her from all blame 
KING LEAR  
My curses on her 
REGAN  
O sir you are old 
Nature in you stands on the very verge 
Of her confine you should be ruled and led 
By some discretion that discerns your state 
Better than you yourself Therefore I pray you 
That to our sister you do make return 
Say you have wrongd her sir 
KING LEAR  
Ask her forgiveness 
Do you but mark how this becomes the house 
Dear daughter I confess that I am old 
Kneeling
