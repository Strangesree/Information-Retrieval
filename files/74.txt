74 
 To EDGAR  
Come sit thou here most learned justicer 
To the Fool  
Thou sapient sir sit here Now you she foxes 
EDGAR  
Look where he stands and glares 
Wantest thou eyes at trial madam 
Come oer the bourn Bessy to me  
Fool  
Her boat hath a leak 
And she must not speak 
Why she dares not come over to thee 
EDGAR  
The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a 
nightingale Hopdance cries in Toms belly for two 
white herring Croak not black angel I have no 
food for thee 
KENT  
How do you sir Stand you not so amazed 
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions 
KING LEAR  
Ill see their trial first Bring in the evidence 
To EDGAR  
Thou robed man of justice take thy place 
To the Fool  
And thou his yokefellow of equity 
Bench by his side 
To KENT  
you are o the commission 
Sit you too 
EDGAR  
Let us deal justly 
Sleepest or wakest thou jolly shepherd 
Thy sheep be in the corn
