 KENT  
To be acknowledged madam is oerpaid 
All my reports go with the modest truth 
Nor more nor clippd but so 
CORDELIA  
Be better suited 
These weeds are memories of those worser hours 
I prithee put them off 
KENT  
Pardon me dear mada m 
Yet to be known shortens my made intent 
My boon I make it that you know me not 
Till time and I think meet 
CORDELIA  
Then bet so my good lord 
To the Doctor  
How does the king 
Doctor  
Madam sleeps still 
CORDELIA  
O you kind gods 
Cure this great breach in his abused nature 
The untuned and jarring senses O wind up 
Of this childchanged father 
Doctor  
So please your majesty 
That we may wake the king he hath slept long 
CORDELIA  
Be governd by your knowledge and proceed 
I the sway of your own will Is he arrayd 
Gentleman  
Ay madam in the heaviness of his sleep 
We put fresh garments on him 
Doctor  
Be by good madam when we do awake him 
I doubt not of his temperance 
CORDELIA  
Very well 
Doctor
