 Robes and furrd gowns hide all Plate sin with gold 
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks 
Arm it in rags a pigmys straw does pierce it 
None does offend none I say none Ill able em 
Take that of me my friend who have the power 
To seal the accusers lips Get thee glass eyes 
And like a scurvy politician seem 
To see the things thou dost not Now now now now 
Pull off my boots harder harder so 
EDGAR  
O matter and impertinency mixd Reason in madness 
KING LEAR  
If thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes 
I know thee well enough thy name is Gloucester 
Thou must be patient we came crying hither 
Thou knowst the first time that we smell the air 
We wawl and cry I will preach to thee mark 
GLOUCESTER  
Alack alack the day 
KING LEAR  
When we are born we cry that we are come 
To this great stage of fools this a good block 
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe 
A troop of horse with felt Ill put t in proof 
And when I have stoln upon these sons inlaw 
Then kill kill kill kill kill kill 
Enter a Gentleman with Attendants  
Gentleman  
O here he is lay hand upon him Sir 
Your most dear daughter  
KING LEAR  
No rescue What a prisoner I am even 
The natural fool of fortune Use me well 
You shall have ransom Let me have surgeons 
I am cut to the brains 
Gentleman  
You shall have any thing 
KING LEAR  
No seconds all myself 
Why this would make a man a man of salt
