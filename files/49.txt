KING LEAR  
They durst not do t 
They could not would not do t tis worse than murder 
To do upon respect such violent outrage 
Resolve me with all modest haste which way 
Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage 
Coming from us 
KENT  
My lord when at their home 
I did commend your highness letters to them 
Ere I was risen from the place that showd 
My duty kneeling came there a reeking post 
Stewd in his haste half breathless panting forth 
From Goneril his mistress salutations 
Deliverd letters spite of intermission 
Which presently they read on whose contents 
They summond up their meiny straight took horse 
Commanded me to follow and attend 
The leisure of their answer gave me cold looks 
And meeting here the other messenger 
Whose welcome I perceived had poisond mine  
Being the very fellow that of late 
Displayd so saucily against your highness  
Having more man than wit about me drew 
He raised the house with loud and coward cries 
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth 
The shame which here it suffers 
Fool
