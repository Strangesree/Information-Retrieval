 REGAN  
Faith he is posted hence on serious matter 
It was great ignorance Gloucesters eyes being out 
To let him live where he arrives he moves 
All hearts against us Edmund I think is gone 
In pity of his misery to dispatch 
His nighted life moreover to descry 
The strength o the enemy 
OSWALD  
I must needs after him madam with my letter 
REGAN  
Our troops set forth tomorrow stay with us 
The ways are dangerous 
OSWALD  
I may not madam 
My lady charged my duty in this business 
REGAN  
Why should she write to Edmund Might not you 
Transport her purposes by word Belike 
Something I know not what Ill love thee much 
Let me unseal the letter 
OSWALD  
Madam I had rather  
REGAN  
I know your lady does not love her husband 
I am sure of that and at her late being here 
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks 
To noble Edmund I know you are of her bosom 
OSWALD  
I madam 
REGAN  
I speak in understanding you are I knowt 
Therefore I do advise you take this note 
My lord is dead Edmund and I have talkd 
And more convenient is he for my hand 
Than for your ladys you may gather more 
If you do find him pray you give him this 
And when your mistress hears thus much from you 
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her 
So fare you well 
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor 
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off
